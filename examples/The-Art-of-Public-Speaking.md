THINGS TO THINK OF FIRST
```

```
A FOREWORD
```

The efficiency of a book is like that of a man, in one important respect: its
attitude toward its subject is the first source of its power. A book may be full of
good ideas well expressed, but if its writer views his subject from the wrong
angle even his excellent advice may prove to be ineffective.

This book stands or falls by its authors' attitude toward its subject. If the best
way to teach oneself or others to speak effectively in public is to fill the mind
with rules, and to set up fixed standards for the interpretation of thought, the
utterance of language, the making of gestures, and all the rest, then this book
will be limited in value to such stray ideas throughout its pages as may prove
helpful to the reader—as an effort to enforce a group of principles it must be
reckoned a failure, because it is then untrue.

It is of some importance, therefore, to those who take up this volume with open
mind that they should see clearly at the out-start what is the thought that at once
underlies and is builded through this structure. In plain words it is this:

Training in public speaking is not a matter of externals—primarily; it is not a
matter of imitation—fundamentally; it is not a matter of conformity to standards

—at all. Public speaking is public utterance, public issuance, of the man himself;
therefore the first thing both in time and in importance is that the man should be
and think and feel things that are worthy of being given forth. Unless there be
something of value within, no tricks of training can ever make of the talker
anything more than a machine—albeit a highly perfected machine—for the
delivery of other men's goods. So self-development is fundamental in our plan.

The second principle lies close to the first: The man must enthrone his will to
rule over his thought, his feelings, and all his physical powers, so that the outer
self may give perfect, unhampered expression to the inner. It is futile, we assert,
to lay down systems of rules for voice culture, intonation, gesture, and what not,
unless these two principles of having something to say and making the will
sovereign have at least begun to make themselves felt in the life.

The third principle will, we surmise, arouse no dispute: No one can learn _how_ to
speak who does not first speak as best he can. That may seem like a vicious
circle in statement, but it will bear examination.

Many teachers have begun with the _how_. Vain effort! It is an ancient truism that
we learn to do by doing. The first thing for the beginner in public speaking is to
speak—not to study voice and gesture and the rest. Once he has spoken he can
improve himself by self-observation or according to the criticisms of those who
hear.

But how shall he be able to criticise himself? Simply by finding out three things:
What are the qualities which by common consent go to make up an effective
speaker; by what means at least some of these qualities may be acquired; and
what wrong habits of speech in himself work against his acquiring and using the
qualities which he finds to be good.

Experience, then, is not only the best teacher, but the first and the last. But
experience must be a dual thing—the experience of others must be used to
supplement, correct and justify our own experience; in this way we shall become
our own best critics only after we have trained ourselves in self-knowledge, the
knowledge of what other minds think, and in the ability to judge ourselves by the
standards we have come to believe are right. "If I ought," said Kant, "I can."

An examination of the contents of this volume will show how consistently these
articles of faith have been declared, expounded, and illustrated. The student is
urged to begin to speak at once of what he knows. Then he is given simple
suggestions for self-control, with gradually increasing emphasis upon the power

of the inner man over the outer. Next, the way to the rich storehouses of material
is pointed out. And finally, all the while he is urged to speak, _speak_, _SPEAK_ as
he is applying to his own methods, in his own _personal_ way, the principles he
has gathered from his own experience and observation and the recorded
experiences of others.

So now at the very first let it be as clear as light that methods are secondary
matters; that the full mind, the warm heart, the dominant will are primary—and
not only primary but paramount; for unless it be a full being that uses the
methods it will be like dressing a wooden image in the clothes of a man.

Sense never fails to give them that have it, Words enough to make
them understood. It too often happens in some conversations, as in
Apothecary Shops, that those Pots that are Empty, or have Things of
small Value in them, are as gaudily Dress'd as those that are full of
precious Drugs.

CHAPTER I
```

```
ACQUIRING CONFIDENCE BEFORE AN AUDIENCE
```

```
There is a strange sensation often experienced in the presence of an
audience. It may proceed from the gaze of the many eyes that turn
upon the speaker, especially if he permits himself to steadily return
that gaze. Most speakers have been conscious of this in a nameless
thrill, a real something, pervading the atmosphere, tangible,
evanescent, indescribable. All writers have borne testimony to the
power of a speaker's eye in impressing an audience. This influence
which we are now considering is the reverse of that picture—the
power their eyes may exert upon him, especially before he begins to
speak: after the inward fires of oratory are fanned into flame the
eyes of the audience lose all terror.—WILLIAM PITTENGER, Extempore
Speech.
```

Students of public speaking continually ask, "How can I overcome self-
consciousness and the fear that paralyzes me before an audience?"

Did you ever notice in looking from a train window that some horses feed near
the track and never even pause to look up at the thundering cars, while just ahead
at the next railroad crossing a farmer's wife will be nervously trying to quiet her
scared horse as the train goes by?

How would you cure a horse that is afraid of cars—graze him in a back-woods
lot where he would never see steam-engines or automobiles, or drive or pasture
him where he would frequently see the machines?

Apply horse-sense to ridding yourself of self-consciousness and fear: face an
audience as frequently as you can, and you will soon stop shying. You can never
attain freedom from stage-fright by reading a treatise. A book may give you
excellent suggestions on how best to conduct yourself in the water, but sooner or
later you must get wet, perhaps even strangle and be "half scared to death."
There are a great many "wetless" bathing suits worn at the seashore, but no one
ever learns to swim in them. To plunge is the only way.

Practise, _practise_, _PRACTISE_ in speaking before an audience will tend to
remove all fear of audiences, just as practise in swimming will lead to
confidence and facility in the water. You must learn to speak by speaking.

The Apostle Paul tells us that every man must work out his own salvation. All
we can do here is to offer you suggestions as to how best to prepare for your
plunge. The real plunge no one can take for you. A doctor may prescribe, but _you_
must take the medicine.

Do not be disheartened if at first you suffer from stage-fright. Dan Patch was
more susceptible to suffering than a superannuated dray horse would be. It never
hurts a fool to appear before an audience, for his capacity is not a capacity for
feeling. A blow that would kill a civilized man soon heals on a savage. The
higher we go in the scale of life, the greater is the capacity for suffering.

For one reason or another, some master-speakers never entirely overcome stage-
fright, but it will pay you to spare no pains to conquer it. Daniel Webster failed
in his first appearance and had to take his seat without finishing his speech
because he was nervous. Gladstone was often troubled with self-consciousness
in the beginning of an address. Beecher was always perturbed before talking in
public.

Blacksmiths sometimes twist a rope tight around the nose of a horse, and by thus
inflicting a little pain they distract his attention from the shoeing process. One

way to get air out of a glass is to pour in water.

_Be Absorbed by Your Subject_

Apply the blacksmith's homely principle when you are speaking. If you feel
deeply about your subject you will be able to think of little else. Concentration is
a process of distraction from less important matters. It is too late to think about
the cut of your coat when once you are upon the platform, so centre your interest
on what you are about to say—fill your mind with your speech-material and, like
the infilling water in the glass, it will drive out your unsubstantial fears.

Self-consciousness is undue consciousness of self, and, for the purpose of
delivery, self is secondary to your subject, not only in the opinion of the
audience, but, if you are wise, in your own. To hold any other view is to regard
yourself as an exhibit instead of as a messenger with a message worth delivering.
Do you remember Elbert Hubbard's tremendous little tract, "A Message to
Garcia"? The youth subordinated himself to the message he bore. So must you,
by all the determination you can muster. It is sheer egotism to fill your mind with
thoughts of self when a greater thing is there—_TRUTH_. Say this to yourself
sternly, and shame your self-consciousness into quiescence. If the theater caught
fire you could rush to the stage and shout directions to the audience without any
self-consciousness, for the importance of what you were saying would drive all
fear-thoughts out of your mind.

Far worse than self-consciousness through fear of doing poorly is self-
consciousness through assumption of doing well. The first sign of greatness is
when a man does not attempt to look and act great. Before you can call yourself
a man at all, Kipling assures us, you must "not look too good nor talk too wise."

Nothing advertises itself so thoroughly as conceit. One may be so full of self as
to be empty. Voltaire said, "We must conceal self-love." But that can not be
done. You know this to be true, for you have recognized overweening self-love
in others. If you have it, others are seeing it in you. There are things in this world
bigger than self, and in working for them self will be forgotten, or—what is
better—remembered only so as to help us win toward higher things.

_Have Something to Say_

The trouble with many speakers is that they go before an audience with their
minds a blank. It is no wonder that nature, abhorring a vacuum, fills them with
the nearest thing handy, which generally happens to be, "I wonder if I am doing

this right! How does my hair look? I know I shall fail." Their prophetic souls are
sure to be right.

It is not enough to be absorbed by your subject—to acquire self-confidence you
must have something in which to be confident. If you go before an audience
without any preparation, or previous knowledge of your subject, you ought to be
self-conscious—you ought to be ashamed to steal the time of your audience.
Prepare yourself. Know what you are going to talk about, and, in general, how
you are going to say it. Have the first few sentences worked out completely so
that you may not be troubled in the beginning to find words. Know your subject
better than your hearers know it, and you have nothing to fear.

_After Preparing for Success, Expect It_

Let your bearing be modestly confident, but most of all be modestly confident
within. Over-confidence is bad, but to tolerate premonitions of failure is worse,
for a bold man may win attention by his very bearing, while a rabbit-hearted
coward invites disaster.

Humility is not the personal discount that we must offer in the presence of others
—against this old interpretation there has been a most healthy modern reaction.
True humility any man who thoroughly knows himself must feel; but it is not a
humility that assumes a worm-like meekness; it is rather a strong, vibrant prayer
for greater power for service—a prayer that Uriah Heep could never have
uttered.

Washington Irving once introduced Charles Dickens at a dinner given in the
latter's honor. In the middle of his speech Irving hesitated, became embarrassed,
and sat down awkwardly. Turning to a friend beside him he remarked, "There, I
told you I would fail, and I did."

If you believe you will fail, there is no hope for you. You will.

Rid yourself of this I-am-a-poor-worm-in-the-dust idea. You are a god, with
infinite capabilities. "All things are ready if the mind be so." The eagle looks the
cloudless sun in the face.

_Assume Mastery Over Your Audience_

In public speech, as in electricity, there is a positive and a negative force. Either
you or your audience are going to possess the positive factor. If you assume it
you can almost invariably make it yours. If you assume the negative you are sure

to be negative. Assuming a virtue or a vice vitalizes it. Summon all your power
of self-direction, and remember that though your audience is infinitely more
important than you, the truth is more important than both of you, because it is
eternal. If your mind falters in its leadership the sword will drop from your
hands. Your assumption of being able to instruct or lead or inspire a multitude or
even a small group of people may appall you as being colossal impudence—as
indeed it may be; but having once essayed to speak, be courageous. _BE_
courageous—it lies within you to be what you will. _MAKE_ yourself be calm and
confident.

Reflect that your audience will not hurt you. If Beecher in Liverpool had spoken
behind a wire screen he would have invited the audience to throw the over-ripe
missiles with which they were loaded; but he was a man, confronted his hostile
hearers fearlessly—and won them.

In facing your audience, pause a moment and look them over—a hundred
chances to one they want you to succeed, for what man is so foolish as to spend
his time, perhaps his money, in the hope that you will waste his investment by
talking dully?

_Concluding Hints_

Do not make haste to begin—haste shows lack of control.

Do not apologize. It ought not to be necessary; and if it is, it will not help. Go
straight ahead.

Take a deep breath, relax, and begin in a quiet conversational tone as though you
were speaking to one large friend. You will not find it half so bad as you
imagined; really, it is like taking a cold plunge: after you are in, the water is fine.
In fact, having spoken a few times you will even anticipate the plunge with
exhilaration. To stand before an audience and make them think your thoughts
after you is one of the greatest pleasures you can ever know. Instead of fearing it,
you ought to be as anxious as the fox hounds straining at their leashes, or the
race horses tugging at their reins.

So cast out fear, for fear is cowardly—when it is not mastered. The bravest know
fear, but they do not yield to it. Face your audience pluckily—if your knees
quake, _MAKE_ them stop. In your audience lies some victory for you and the
cause you represent. Go win it. Suppose Charles Martell had been afraid to
hammer the Saracen at Tours; suppose Columbus had feared to venture out into

the unknown West; suppose our forefathers had been too timid to oppose the
tyranny of George the Third; suppose that any man who ever did anything worth
while had been a coward! The world owes its progress to the men who have
dared, and you must dare to speak the effective word that is in your heart to
speak—for often it requires courage to utter a single sentence. But remember
that men erect no monuments and weave no laurels for those who fear to do
what they can.

Is all this unsympathetic, do you say?

Man, what you need is not sympathy, but a push. No one doubts that
temperament and nerves and illness and even praiseworthy modesty may, singly
or combined, cause the speaker's cheek to blanch before an audience, but neither
can any one doubt that coddling will magnify this weakness. The victory lies in a
fearless frame of mind. Prof. Walter Dill Scott says: "Success or failure in
business is caused more by mental attitude even than by mental capacity."
Banish the fear-attitude; acquire the confident attitude. And remember that the
only way to acquire it is—_to acquire it_.

In this foundation chapter we have tried to strike the tone of much that is to
follow. Many of these ideas will be amplified and enforced in a more specific
way; but through all these chapters on an art which Mr. Gladstone believed to be
more powerful than the public press, the note of _justifiable self-confidence_ must
sound again and again.

CHAPTER II
```

```
THE SIN OF MONOTONY
```

```
One day Ennui was born from Uniformity.—MOTTE.
```

Our English has changed with the years so that many words now connote more
than they did originally. This is true of the word _monotonous_. From "having but
one tone," it has come to mean more broadly, "lack of variation."

The monotonous speaker not only drones along in the same volume and pitch of
tone but uses always the same emphasis, the same speed, the same thoughts—or
dispenses with thought altogether.

Monotony, the cardinal and most common sin of the public speaker, is not a
transgression—it is rather a sin of omission, for it consists in living up to the
confession of the Prayer Book: "We have left undone those things we ought to
have done."

Emerson says, "The virtue of art lies in detachment, in sequestering one object
from the embarrassing variety." That is just what the monotonous speaker fails to
do—he does _not_ detach one thought or phrase from another, they are all
expressed in the same manner.

To tell you that your speech is monotonous may mean very little to you, so let us
look at the nature—and the curse—of monotony in other spheres of life, then we
shall appreciate more fully how it will blight an otherwise good speech.

If the Victrola in the adjoining apartment grinds out just three selections over
and over again, it is pretty safe to assume that your neighbor has no other
records. If a speaker uses only a few of his powers, it points very plainly to the
fact that the rest of his powers are not developed. Monotony reveals our
limitations.

In its effect on its victim, monotony is actually deadly—it will drive the bloom
from the cheek and the lustre from the eye as quickly as sin, and often leads to
viciousness. The worst punishment that human ingenuity has ever been able to
invent is extreme monotony—solitary confinement. Lay a marble on the table
and do nothing eighteen hours of the day but change that marble from one point
to another and back again, and you will go insane if you continue long enough.

So this thing that shortens life, and is used as the most cruel of punishments in
our prisons, is the thing that will destroy all the life and force of a speech. Avoid
it as you would shun a deadly dull bore. The "idle rich" can have half-a-dozen
homes, command all the varieties of foods gathered from the four corners of the
earth, and sail for Africa or Alaska at their pleasure; but the poverty-stricken
man must walk or take a street car—he does not have the choice of yacht, auto,
or special train. He must spend the most of his life in labor and be content with
the staples of the food-market. Monotony is poverty, whether in speech or in life.
Strive to increase the variety of your speech as the business man labors to
augment his wealth.

Bird-songs, forest glens, and mountains are not monotonous—it is the long rows
of brown-stone fronts and the miles of paved streets that are so terribly same.
Nature in her wealth gives us endless variety; man with his limitations is often
monotonous. Get back to nature in your methods of speech-making.

The power of variety lies in its pleasure-giving quality. The great truths of the
world have often been couched in fascinating stories—"Les Miserables," for
instance. If you wish to teach or influence men, you must please them, first or
last. Strike the same note on the piano over and over again. This will give you
some idea of the displeasing, jarring effect monotony has on the ear. The
dictionary defines "monotonous" as being synonymous with "wearisome." That
is putting it mildly. It is maddening. The department-store prince does not
disgust the public by playing only the one tune, "Come Buy My Wares!" He
gives recitals on a $[^1]:[^2]:[^5]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: organ, and the pleased people naturally slip into a
buying mood.

_How to Conquer Monotony_

We obviate monotony in dress by replenishing our wardrobes. We avoid
monotony in speech by multiplying our powers of speech. We multiply our
powers of speech by increasing our tools.

The carpenter has special implements with which to construct the several parts
of a building. The organist has certain keys and stops which he manipulates to
produce his harmonies and effects. In like manner the speaker has certain
instruments and tools at his command by which he builds his argument, plays on
the feelings, and guides the beliefs of his audience. To give you a conception of
these instruments, and practical help in learning to use them, are the purposes of
the immediately following chapters.

Why did not the Children of Israel whirl through the desert in limousines, and
why did not Noah have moving-picture entertainments and talking machines on
the Ark? The laws that enable us to operate an automobile, produce moving-
pictures, or music on the Victrola, would have worked just as well then as they
do today. It was ignorance of law that for ages deprived humanity of our modern
conveniences. Many speakers still use ox-cart methods in their speech instead of
employing automobile or overland-express methods. They are ignorant of laws
that make for efficiency in speaking. Just to the extent that you regard and use
the laws that we are about to examine and learn how to use will you have
efficiency and force in your speaking; and just to the extent that you disregard
them will your speaking be feeble and ineffective. We cannot impress too
thoroughly upon you the necessity for a real working mastery of these principles.
They are the very foundations of successful speaking. "Get your principles
right," said Napoleon, "and the rest is a matter of detail."

It is useless to shoe a dead horse, and all the sound principles in Christendom
will never make a live speech out of a dead one. So let it be understood that
public speaking is not a matter of mastering a few dead rules; the most important
law of public speech is the necessity for truth, force, feeling, and life. Forget all
else, but not this.

When you have mastered the mechanics of speech outlined in the next few
chapters you will no longer be troubled with monotony. The complete
knowledge of these principles and the ability to apply them will give you great
variety in your powers of expression. But they cannot be mastered and applied
by thinking or reading about them—you must practise, _practise_, _PRACTISE_. If

no one else will listen to you, listen to yourself—you must always be your own
best critic, and the severest one of all.

The technical principles that we lay down in the following chapters are not
arbitrary creations of our own. They are all founded on the practices that good
speakers and actors adopt—either naturally and unconsciously or under
instruction—in getting their effects.

It is useless to warn the student that he must be natural. To be natural may be to
be monotonous. The little strawberry up in the arctics with a few tiny seeds and
an acid tang is a natural berry, but it is not to be compared with the improved
variety that we enjoy here. The dwarfed oak on the rocky hillside is natural, but
a poor thing compared with the beautiful tree found in the rich, moist bottom
lands. Be natural—but improve your natural gifts until you have approached the
ideal, for we must strive after idealized nature, in fruit, tree, and speech.

CHAPTER III
```

```
EFFICIENCY THROUGH EMPHASIS AND SUBORDINATION
```

```
In a word, the principle of emphasis... is followed best, not by
remembering particular rules, but by being full of a particular
feeling.—C.S. BALDWIN, Writing and Speaking.
```

The gun that scatters too much does not bag the birds. The same principle
applies to speech. The speaker that fires his force and emphasis at random into a
sentence will not get results. Not every word is of special importance—therefore
only certain words demand emphasis.

You say Massa_CHU_setts and Minne_AP_olis, you do not emphasize each syllable
alike, but hit the accented syllable with force and hurry over the unimportant
ones. Now why do you not apply this principle in speaking a sentence? To some
extent you do, in ordinary speech; but do you in public discourse? It is there that
monotony caused by lack of emphasis is so painfully apparent.

So far as emphasis is concerned, you may consider the average sentence as just
one big word, with the important word as the accented syllable. Note the
following:

"Destiny is not a matter of chance. It is a matter of choice."

You might as well say _MASS-A-CHU-SETTS_, emphasizing every syllable
equally, as to lay equal stress on each word in the foregoing sentences.

Speak it aloud and see. Of course you will want to emphasize _destiny_, for it is
the principal idea in your declaration, and you will put some emphasis on _not_,
else your hearers may think you are affirming that destiny _is_ a matter of chance.
By all means you must emphasize _chance_, for it is one of the two big ideas in the
statement.

Another reason why _chance_ takes emphasis is that it is contrasted with _choice_ in
the next sentence. Obviously, the author has contrasted these ideas purposely, so
that they might be more emphatic, and here we see that contrast is one of the
very first devices to gain emphasis.

As a public speaker you can assist this emphasis of contrast with your voice. If
you say, "My horse is not _black_," what color immediately comes into mind?
White, naturally, for that is the opposite of black. If you wish to bring out the
thought that destiny is a matter of choice, you can do so more effectively by first
saying that "_DESTINY_ is _NOT_ a matter of _CHANCE_." Is not the color of the
horse impressed upon us more emphatically when you say, "My horse is _NOT_

_BLACK_. He is _WHITE_" than it would be by hearing you assert merely that your
horse is white?

In the second sentence of the statement there is only one important word
—_choice_. It is the one word that positively defines the quality of the subject
being discussed, and the author of those lines desired to bring it out
emphatically, as he has shown by contrasting it with another idea. These lines,
then, would read like this:

"_DESTINY_ is _NOT_ a matter of _CHANCE_. It is a matter of _CHOICE_." Now read
this over, striking the words in capitals with a great deal of force.

In almost every sentence there are a few _MOUNTAIN PEAK WORDS_ that
represent the big, important ideas. When you pick up the evening paper you can
tell at a glance which are the important news articles. Thanks to the editor, he
does not tell about a "hold up" in Hong Kong in the same sized type as he uses to
report the death of five firemen in your home city. Size of type is his device to
show emphasis in bold relief. He brings out sometimes even in red headlines the
striking news of the day.

It would be a boon to speech-making if speakers would conserve the attention of
their audiences in the same way and emphasize only the words representing the
important ideas. The average speaker will deliver the foregoing line on destiny
with about the same amount of emphasis on each word. Instead of saying, "It is a
matter of _CHOICE_," he will deliver it, "It is a matter of choice," or "_IT IS A_
_MATTER OF CHOICE_"—both equally bad.

Charles Dana, the famous editor of _The New York Sun_, told one of his reporters
that if he went up the street and saw a dog bite a man, to pay no attention to it.
_The Sun_ could not afford to waste the time and attention of its readers on such
unimportant happenings. "But," said Mr. Dana, "if you see a man bite a dog,
hurry back to the office and write the story." Of course that is news; that is
unusual.

Now the speaker who says "_IT IS A MATTER OF CHOICE_" is putting too much
emphasis upon things that are of no more importance to metropolitan readers
than a dog bite, and when he fails to emphasize "choice" he is like the reporter
who "passes up" the man's biting a dog. The ideal speaker makes his big words
stand out like mountain peaks; his unimportant words are submerged like
stream-beds. His big thoughts stand like huge oaks; his ideas of no especial
value are merely like the grass around the tree.

From all this we may deduce this important principle: _EMPHASIS_ is a matter of
_CONTRAST_ and _COMPARISON_.

Recently the _New York American_ featured an editorial by Arthur Brisbane. Note
the following, printed in the same type as given here.

**We do not know what the President THOUGHT when he got that message,**
**or what the elephant thinks when he sees the mouse, but we do know what**
**the President DID.**

The words _THOUGHT_ and _DID_ immediately catch the reader's attention because
they are different from the others, not especially because they are larger. If all the
rest of the words in this sentence were made ten times as large as they are, and
_DID_ and _THOUGHT_ were kept at their present size, they would still be
emphatic, because different.

Take the following from Robert Chambers' novel, "The Business of Life." The
words _you_, _had_, _would_, are all emphatic, because they have been made different.

```
He looked at her in angry astonishment.
```

```
"Well, what do you call it if it isn't cowardice—to slink off and
marry a defenseless girl like that!"
```

```
"Did you expect me to give you a chance to destroy me and poison
Jacqueline's mind? If I had been guilty of the thing with which you
charge me, what I have done would have been cowardly. Otherwise,
it is justified."
```

A Fifth Avenue bus would attract attention up at Minisink Ford, New York,
while one of the ox teams that frequently pass there would attract attention on
Fifth Avenue. To make a word emphatic, deliver it differently from the manner
in which the words surrounding it are delivered. If you have been talking loudly,
utter the emphatic word in a concentrated whisper—and you have intense
emphasis. If you have been going fast, go very slow on the emphatic word. If
you have been talking on a low pitch, jump to a high one on the emphatic word.
If you have been talking on a high pitch, take a low one on your emphatic ideas.
Read the chapters on "Inflection," "Feeling," "Pause," "Change of Pitch,"
"Change of Tempo." Each of these will explain in detail how to get emphasis
through the use of a certain principle.

In this chapter, however, we are considering only one form of emphasis: that of

applying force to the important word and subordinating the unimportant words.
Do not forget: this is one of the main methods that you must continually employ
in getting your effects.

Let us not confound loudness with emphasis. To yell is not a sign of earnestness,
intelligence, or feeling. The kind of force that we want applied to the emphatic
word is not entirely physical. True, the emphatic word may be spoken more
loudly, or it may be spoken more softly, but the _real_ quality desired is intensity,
earnestness. It must come from within, outward.

Last night a speaker said: "The curse of this country is not a lack of education.
It's politics." He emphasized _curse, lack, education, politics_. The other words
were hurried over and thus given no comparative importance at all. The word
_politics_ was flamed out with great feeling as he slapped his hands together
indignantly. His emphasis was both correct and powerful. He concentrated all
our attention on the words that meant something, instead of holding it up on such
words as _of this_, _a_, _of_, _It's_.

What would you think of a guide who agreed to show New York to a stranger
and then took up his time by visiting Chinese laundries and boot-blacking
"parlors" on the side streets? There is only one excuse for a speaker's asking the
attention of his audience: He must have either truth or entertainment for them. If
he wearies their attention with trifles they will have neither vivacity nor desire
left when he reaches words of Wall-Street and skyscraper importance. You do
not dwell on these small words in your everyday conversation, because you are
not a conversational bore. Apply the correct method of everyday speech to the
platform. As we have noted elsewhere, public speaking is very much like
conversation enlarged.

Sometimes, for big emphasis, it is advisable to lay stress on every single syllable
in a word, as _absolutely_ in the following sentence:

```
I ab-so-lute-ly refuse to grant your demand.
```

Now and then this principle should be applied to an emphatic sentence by
stressing each word. It is a good device for exciting special attention, and it
furnishes a pleasing variety. Patrick Henry's notable climax could be delivered in
that manner very effectively: "Give—me—liberty—or—give—me—death." The
italicized part of the following might also be delivered with this every-word
emphasis. Of course, there are many ways of delivering it; this is only one of
several good interpretations that might be chosen.

```
Knowing the price we must pay, the sacrifice we must make, the
burdens we must carry, the assaults we must endure—knowing full
well the cost—yet we enlist, and we enlist for the war. For we know
the justice of our cause, and we know, too, its certain triumph.
```

Strongly emphasizing a single word has a tendency to suggest its antithesis.
Notice how the meaning changes by merely putting the emphasis on different
words in the following sentence. The parenthetical expressions would really not
be needed to supplement the emphatic words.

```
I intended to buy a house this Spring (even if you did not).
```

```
I INTENDED to buy a house this Spring (but something prevented).
```

```
I intended to BUY a house this Spring (instead of renting as
heretofore).
```

```
I intended to buy a HOUSE this Spring (and not an automobile).
```

```
I intended to buy a house THIS Spring (instead of next Spring).
```

```
I intended to buy a house this SPRING (instead of in the Autumn).
```

When a great battle is reported in the papers, they do not keep emphasizing the
same facts over and over again. They try to get new information, or a "new
slant." The news that takes an important place in the morning edition will be
relegated to a small space in the late afternoon edition. We are interested in new
ideas and new facts. This principle has a very important bearing in determining
your emphasis. Do not emphasize the same idea over and over again unless you

desire to lay extra stress on it; Senator Thurston desired to put the maximum
amount of emphasis on "force" in his speech on page [^5]:[^0]:. Note how force is
emphasized repeatedly. As a general rule, however, the new idea, the "new
slant," whether in a newspaper report of a battle or a speaker's enunciation of his
ideas, is emphatic.

In the following selection, "larger" is emphatic, for it is the new idea. All men
have eyes, but this man asks for a _LARGER_ eye.

This man with the larger eye says he will discover, not rivers or safety
appliances for aeroplanes, but _NEW STARS_ and _SUNS_. "New stars and suns" are
hardly as emphatic as the word "larger." Why? Because we expect an astronomer
to discover heavenly bodies rather than cooking recipes. The words, "Republic
needs" in the next sentence, are emphatic; they introduce a new and important
idea. Republics have always needed men, but the author says they need _NEW_
men. "New" is emphatic because it introduces a new idea. In like manner, "soil,"
"grain," "tools," are also emphatic.

The most emphatic words are italicized in this selection. Are there any others
you would emphasize? Why?

```
The old astronomer said, "Give me a larger eye, and I will discover
new stars and suns." That is what the republic needs today—new
men—men who are wise toward the soil, toward the grains, toward
the tools. If God would only raise up for the people two or three men
like Watt, Fulton and McCormick, they would be worth more to the
State than that treasure box named California or Mexico. And the
real supremacy of man is based upon his capacity for education.
Man is unique in the length of his childhood, which means the
period of plasticity and education. The childhood of a moth, the
distance that stands between the hatching of the robin and its
maturity, represent a few hours or a few weeks, but twenty years for
growth stands between man's cradle and his citizenship. This
protracted childhood makes it possible to hand over to the boy all
the accumulated stores achieved by races and civilizations through
thousands of years.

You must understand that there are no steel-riveted rules of emphasis. It is not
always possible to designate which word must, and which must not be

emphasized. One speaker will put one interpretation on a speech, another
speaker will use different emphasis to bring out a different interpretation. No one
can say that one interpretation is right and the other wrong. This principle must
be borne in mind in all our marked exercises. Here your own intelligence must
guide—and greatly to your profit.

CHAPTER IV
```

```
EFFICIENCY THROUGH CHANGE OF PITCH
```

```
Speech is simply a modified form of singing: the principal
difference being in the fact that in singing the vowel sounds are
prolonged and the intervals are short, whereas in speech the words
are uttered in what may be called "staccato" tones, the vowels not
being specially prolonged and the intervals between the words being
more distinct. The fact that in singing we have a larger range of
tones does not properly distinguish it from ordinary speech. In
```

```
speech we have likewise a variation of tones, and even in ordinary
conversation there is a difference of from three to six semi-tones, as
I have found in my investigations, and in some persons the range is
as high as one octave.—WILLIAM SCHEPPEGRELL, Popular Science
Monthly.
```

By pitch, as everyone knows, we mean the relative position of a vocal tone—as,
high, medium, low, or any variation between. In public speech we apply it not
only to a single utterance, as an exclamation or a monosyllable (_Oh!_ or _the_) but
to any group of syllables, words, and even sentences that may be spoken in a
single tone. This distinction it is important to keep in mind, for the efficient
speaker not only changes the pitch of successive syllables (see Chapter VII,
"Efficiency through Inflection"), but gives a different pitch to different parts, or
word-groups, of successive sentences. It is this phase of the subject which we are
considering in this chapter.

_Every Change in the Thought Demands a Change in the Voice-Pitch_

Whether the speaker follows the rule consciously, unconsciously, or
subconsciously, this is the logical basis upon which all good voice variation is
made, yet this law is violated more often than any other by _public_ speakers. A
criminal may disregard a law of the state without detection and punishment, but
the speaker who violates this regulation suffers its penalty at once in his loss of
effectiveness, while his innocent hearers must endure the monotony—for
monotony is not only a sin of the perpetrator, as we have shown, but a plague on
the victims as well.

Change of pitch is a stumbling block for almost all beginners, and for many
experienced speakers also. This is especially true when the words of the speech
have been memorized.

If you wish to hear how pitch-monotony sounds, strike the same note on the
piano over and over again. You have in your speaking voice a range of pitch
from high to low, with a great many shades between the extremes. With all these
notes available there is no excuse for offending the ears and taste of your
audience by continually using the one note. True, the reiteration of the same tone
in music—as in pedal point on an organ composition—may be made the
foundation of beauty, for the harmony weaving about that one basic tone
produces a consistent, insistent quality not felt in pure variety of chord
sequences. In like manner the intoning voice in a ritual may—though it rarely

does—possess a solemn beauty. But the public speaker should shun the
monotone as he would a pestilence.

_Continual Change of Pitch is Nature's Highest Method_

In our search for the principles of efficiency we must continually go back to
nature. Listen—really listen—to the birds sing. Which of these feathered tribes
are most pleasing in their vocal efforts: those whose voices, though sweet, have
little or no range, or those that, like the canary, the lark, and the nightingale, not
only possess a considerable range but utter their notes in continual variety of
combinations? Even a sweet-toned chirp, when reiterated without change, may
grow maddening to the enforced listener.

The little child seldom speaks in a monotonous pitch. Observe the conversations
of little folk that you hear on the street or in the home, and note the continual
changes of pitch. The unconscious speech of most adults is likewise full of
pleasing variations.

Imagine someone speaking the following, and consider if the effect would not be
just about as indicated. Remember, we are not now discussing the inflection of
single words, but the general pitch in which phrases are spoken.

(High pitch) "I'd like to leave for my vacation tomorrow,—(lower) still, I have so
much to do. (Higher) Yet I suppose if I wait until I have time I'll never go."

Repeat this, first in the pitches indicated, and then all in the one pitch, as many
speakers would. Observe the difference in naturalness of effect.

The following exercise should be spoken in a purely conversational tone, with
numerous changes of pitch. Practise it until your delivery would cause a stranger
in the next room to think you were discussing an actual incident with a friend,
instead of delivering a memorized monologue. If you are in doubt about the
effect you have secured, repeat it to a friend and ask him if it sounds like
memorized words. If it does, it is wrong.

```
A SIMILAR CASE
```

```
Jack, I hear you've gone and done it.—Yes, I know; most fellows
will; went and tried it once myself, sir, though you see I'm single
still. And you met her—did you tell me—down at Newport, last
July, and resolved to ask the question at a soirée? So did I.
```

```
I suppose you left the ball-room, with its music and its light; for they
say love's flame is brightest in the darkness of the night. Well, you
walked along together, overhead the starlit sky; and I'll bet—old
man, confess it—you were frightened. So was I.
```

```
So you strolled along the terrace, saw the summer moonlight pour
all its radiance on the waters, as they rippled on the shore, till at
length you gathered courage, when you saw that none was nigh—
did you draw her close and tell her that you loved her? So did I.
```

```
Well, I needn't ask you further, and I'm sure I wish you joy. Think I'll
wander down and see you when you're married—eh, my boy? When
the honeymoon is over and you're settled down, we'll try—What?
the deuce you say! Rejected—you rejected? So was I.—Anonymous.
```

The necessity for changing pitch is so self-evident that it should be grasped and
applied immediately. However, it requires patient drill to free yourself from
monotony of pitch.

In natural conversation you think of an idea first, and then find words to express
it. In memorized speeches you are liable to speak the words, and then think what
they mean—and many speakers seem to trouble very little even about that. Is it
any wonder that reversing the process should reverse the result? Get back to
nature in your methods of expression.

Read the following selection in a nonchalant manner, never pausing to think
what the words really mean. Try it again, carefully studying the thought you
have assimilated. Believe the idea, desire to express it effectively, and imagine
an audience before you. Look them earnestly in the face and repeat this truth. If
you follow directions, you will note that you have made many changes of pitch
after several readings.

```
It is not work that kills men; it is worry. Work is healthy; you can
hardly put more upon a man than he can bear. Worry is rust upon the
blade. It is not the revolution that destroys the machinery but the
friction.—HENRY WARD BEECHER.
```

_Change of Pitch Produces Emphasis_

This is a highly important statement. Variety in pitch maintains the hearer's
interest, but one of the surest ways to compel attention—to secure unusual

emphasis—is to change the pitch of your voice suddenly and in a marked degree.
A great contrast always arouses attention. White shows whiter against black; a
cannon roars louder in the Sahara silence than in the Chicago hurly burly—these
are simple illustrations of the power of contrast.

```
"What is Congress going to do next?
```

-----------------------------------
(High pitch) |
| I do not know."
-----------------------------------
(Low pitch)

By such sudden change of pitch during a sermon Dr. Newell Dwight Hillis
recently achieved great emphasis and suggested the gravity of the question he
had raised.

The foregoing order of pitch-change might be reversed with equally good effect,
though with a slight change in seriousness—either method produces emphasis
when used intelligently, that is, with a common-sense appreciation of the sort of
emphasis to be attained.

In attempting these contrasts of pitch it is important to avoid unpleasant
extremes. Most speakers pitch their voices too high. One of the secrets of Mr.
Bryan's eloquence is his low, bell-like voice. Shakespeare said that a soft, gentle,
low voice was "an excellent thing in woman;" it is no less so in man, for a voice
need not be blatant to be powerful,—and _must_ not be, to be pleasing.

In closing, let us emphasize anew the importance of using variety of pitch. You
sing up and down the scale, first touching one note and then another above or
below it. Do likewise in speaking.

Thought and individual taste must generally be your guide as to where to use a
low, a moderate, or a high pitch.

_Selections for Practise_

Note: In the following selections, those passages that may best be delivered in a
moderate pitch are printed in ordinary (roman) type. Those which may be
rendered in a high pitch—do not make the mistake of raising the voice too high
—are printed _in italics_. Those which might well be spoken in a low pitch are
printed in _CAPITALS_.

These arrangements, however, are merely suggestive—we cannot make it strong
enough that you must use your own judgment in interpreting a selection. Before

doing so, however, it is well to practise these passages as they are marked.

```
Yes, all men labor. RUFUS CHOATE AND DANIEL WEBSTER
labor, say the critics. But every man who reads of the labor question
knows that it means the movement of the men that earn their living
with their hands; THAT ARE EMPLOYED, AND PAID WAGES: are
gathered under roofs of factories, sent out on farms, sent out on
ships, gathered on the walls. In popular acceptation, the working
class means the men that work with their hands, for wages, so many
hours a day, employed by great capitalists; that work for everybody
else. Why do we move for this class? "Why," asks a critic, "don't you
move FOR ALL WORKINGMEN?" BECAUSE, WHILE DANIEL
WEBSTER GETS FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR ARGUING
THE MEXICAN CLAIMS, there is no need of anybody's moving for
him. BECAUSE, WHILE RUFUS CHOATE GETS FIVE
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR MAKING ONE ARGUMENT TO A
JURY, there is no need of moving for him, or for the men that work
with their brains,—that do highly disciplined and skilled labor,
invent, and write books. The reason why the Labor movement
confines itself to a single class is because that class of work DOES
NOT GET PAID, does not get protection. MENTAL LABOR is
adequately paid, and MORE THAN ADEQUATELY protected. IT
CAN SHIFT ITS CHANNELS; it can vary according to the supply
and demand.

Remember that two sentences, or two parts of the same sentence, which contain
changes of thought, cannot possibly be given effectively in the same key. Let us
repeat, every big change of thought requires a big change of pitch. What the

Learn to speak some thoughts in a very high tone—others in a _very_, _very_ low

storms of winter and of wars—until at last the gloom was broken,

—_once defined in irrepressible difference, once traced in fratricidal_

_CLIMATE ABOVE a fertile soil_ yields to the husbandman every
product of the temperate zone.

There, by night _the cotton whitens beneath the stars,_ and by day
_THE WHEAT LOCKS THE SUNSHINE IN ITS BEARDED SHEAF._
In the same field the clover steals the fragrance of the wind, and
tobacco catches the quick aroma of the rains. _THERE ARE_
_MOUNTAINS STORED WITH EXHAUSTLESS TREASURES:_
_forests—vast and primeval;_ and rivers that, _tumbling or loitering,_
_run wanton to the sea._ Of the three essential items of all industries—
cotton, iron and wood—that region has easy control. _IN COTTON, a_
_fixed monopoly—IN IRON, proven supremacy—IN TIMBER, the_
_reserve supply of the Republic._ From this assured and permanent
advantage, against which artificial conditions cannot much longer
prevail, has grown an amazing system of industries. Not maintained
by human contrivance of tariff or capital, afar off from the fullest
and cheapest source of supply, but resting in divine assurance,
within touch of field and mine and forest—not set amid costly farms
from which competition has driven the farmer in despair, but amid
cheap and sunny lands, rich with agriculture, to which neither season
nor soil has set a limit—this system of industries is mounting to a
splendor that shall dazzle and illumine the world. _THAT, SIR, is the_
_picture and the promise of my home—A LAND BETTER AND_
_FAIRER THAN I HAVE TOLD YOU, and yet but fit setting in its_

EFFICIENCY THROUGH CHANGE OF PACE

The Latins have bequeathed to us a word that has no precise equivalent in our
tongue, therefore we have accepted it, body unchanged—it is the word _tempo_,
and means _rate of movement_, as measured by the time consumed in executing
that movement.

Thus far its use has been largely limited to the vocal and musical arts, but it
would not be surprising to hear tempo applied to more concrete matters, for it
perfectly illustrates the real meaning of the word to say that an ox-cart moves in
slow tempo, an express train in a fast tempo. Our guns that fire six hundred
times a minute, shoot at a fast tempo; the old muzzle loader that required three
minutes to load, shot at a slow tempo. Every musician understands this principle:
it requires longer to sing a half note than it does an eighth note.

Now tempo is a tremendously important element in good platform work, for
when a speaker delivers a whole address at very nearly the same rate of speed he
is depriving himself of one of his chief means of emphasis and power. The
baseball pitcher, the bowler in cricket, the tennis server, all know the value of
change of pace—change of tempo—in delivering their ball, and so must the
public speaker observe its power.

_Change of Tempo Lends Naturalness to the Delivery_

Naturalness, or at least seeming naturalness, as was explained in the chapter on
"Monotony," is greatly to be desired, and a continual change of tempo will go a
long way towards establishing it. Mr. Howard Lindsay, Stage Manager for Miss
Margaret Anglin, recently said to the present writer that change of pace was one
of the most effective tools of the actor. While it must be admitted that the stilted
mouthings of many actors indicate cloudy mirrors, still the public speaker would
do well to study the actor's use of tempo.

There is, however, a more fundamental and effective source at which to study
naturalness—a trait which, once lost, is shy of recapture: that source is the
common conversation of any well-bred circle. _This_ is the standard we strive to
reach on both stage and platform—with certain differences, of course, which will
appear as we go on. If speaker and actor were to reproduce with absolute fidelity
every variation of utterance—every whisper, grunt, pause, silence, and explosion
—of conversation as we find it typically in everyday life, much of the interest
would leave the public utterance. Naturalness in public address is something
more than faithful reproduction of nature—it is the reproduction of those _typical_
parts of nature's work which are truly representative of the whole.

The realistic story-writer understands this in writing dialogue, and we must take
it into account in seeking for naturalness through change of tempo.

Suppose you speak the first of the following sentences in a slow tempo, the
second quickly, observing how natural is the effect. Then speak both with the

same rapidity and note the difference.

```
I can't recall what I did with my knife. Oh, now I remember I gave it
to Mary.
```

We see here that a change of tempo often occurs in the same sentence—for
tempo applies not only to single words, groups of words, and groups of
sentences, but to the major parts of a public speech as well.

```
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES
```

[^1]:. In the following, speak the words "long, long while" very slowly; the rest of
the sentence is spoken in moderately rapid tempo.

```
When you and I behind the Veil are past,
Oh but the long, long while the world shall
last,
Which of our coming and departure heeds,
As the seven seas should heed a pebble cast.

Note: In the following selections the passages that should be given a fast tempo
are in italics; those that should be given in a slow tempo are in small capitals.
Practise these selections, and then try others, changing from fast to slow tempo
on different parts, carefully noting the effect.

FOOL'S GOLD
```

```
See him there, cold and gray,
Watch him as he tries to play;
No, he doesn't know the way—
He began to learn too late.
She's a grim old hag, is Fate,
For she let him have his pile,
Smiling to herself the while,
Knowing what the cost would be,
When he'd found the Golden Key.
Multimillionaire is he,
Many times more rich than we;
But at that I wouldn't trade
With the bargain that he made.
Came here many years ago,
Not a person did he know;
Had the money-hunger bad—
Mad for money, piggish mad;
Didn't let a joy divert him,
Didn't let a sorrow hurt him,
Let his friends and kin desert him,
While he planned and plugged and hurried
```

```
On his quest for gold and power.
Every single wakeful hour
With a money thought he'd dower;
All the while as he grew older,
And grew bolder, he grew colder.
And he thought that some day
He would take the time to play;
But, say—he was wrong.
Life's a song;
```

In the spring
Youth can sing and can fling;
But joys wing
When we're older,
Like birds when it's colder.
The roses were red as he went rushing by,
And glorious tapestries hung in the sky,
And the clover was waving
'Neath honey-bees' slaving;
A bird over there
Roundelayed a soft air;
But the man couldn't spare
Time for gathering flowers,
Or resting in bowers,
Or gazing at skies
That gladdened the eyes.
So he kept on and swept on
Through mean, sordid years.
Now he's up to his ears
In the choicest of stocks.
He owns endless blocks
Of houses and shops,
And the stream never stops
Pouring into his banks.
I suppose that he ranks
Pretty near to the top.
What I have wouldn't sop
His ambition one tittle;
And yet with my little
I don't care to trade

With the bargain he made.
Just watch him to-day—
See him trying to play.
He's come back for blue skies.
But they're in a new guise—
Winter's here, all is gray,
The birds are away,
The meadows are brown,

```
The leaves lie aground,
And the gay brook that wound
With a swirling and whirling
Of waters, is furling
Its bosom in ice.
And he hasn't the price,
With all of his gold,
To buy what he sold.
He knows now the cost
Of the spring-time he lost,
Of the flowers he tossed
From his way,
And, say,
He'd pay
Any price if the day
Could be made not so gray.
He can't play.

_Change of Tempo Prevents Monotony_

The canary in the cage before the window is adding to the beauty and charm of
his singing by a continual change of tempo. If King Solomon had been an orator
he undoubtedly would have gathered wisdom from the song of the wild birds as
well as from the bees. Imagine a song written with but quarter notes. Imagine an
auto with only one speed.

monotony. Where no change of tempo is indicated, use a moderate speed. Too
much of variety would really be a return to monotony.

THE MOB
```

```
"A MOB KILLS THE WRONG MAN" was flashed in a newspaper
headline lately. The mob is an IRRESPONSIBLE, UNTHINKING
MASS. It always destroys BUT NEVER CONSTRUCTS. It
criticises BUT NEVER CREATES.
```

```
Utter a great truth AND THE MOB WILL HATE YOU. See how it
condemned DANTE to EXILE. Encounter the dangers of the
unknown world for its benefit, AND THE MOB WILL DECLARE
YOU CRAZY. It ridiculed COLUMBUS, and for discovering a new
world GAVE HIM PRISON AND CHAINS.
```

```
Write a poem to thrill human hearts with pleasure, AND THE MOB
WILL ALLOW YOU TO GO HUNGRY: THE BLIND HOMER
BEGGED BREAD THROUGH THE STREETS. Invent a machine
to save labor AND THE MOB WILL DECLARE YOU ITS
ENEMY. Less than a hundred years ago a furious rabble smashed
Thimonier's invention, the sewing machine.
```

```
BUILD A STEAMSHIP TO CARRY MERCHANDISE AND
ACCELERATE TRAVEL and the mob will call you a fool. A MOB
LINED THE SHORES OF THE HUDSON RIVER TO LAUGH AT
THE MAIDEN ATTEMPT OF "FULTON'S FOLLY," as they called
his little steamboat.
```

```
Emerson says: "A mob is a society of bodies voluntarily bereaving
themselves of reason and traversing its work. The mob is man
voluntarily descended to the nature of the beast. Its fit hour of
activity is NIGHT. ITS ACTIONS ARE INSANE, like its whole
constitution. It persecutes a principle—IT WOULD WHIP A
RIGHT. It would tar and feather justice by inflicting fire and outrage
```

```
upon the house and persons of those who have these."
```

```
The mob spirit stalks abroad in our land today. Every week gives a
fresh victim to its malignant cry for blood. There were 48 persons
killed by mobs in the United States in 1913; 64 in 1912, and 71 in
1911. Among the 48 last year were a woman and a child. Two
victims were proven innocent after their death.
```

```
IN 399 B.C. A DEMAGOG APPEALED TO THE POPULAR MOB
TO HAVE SOCRATES PUT TO DEATH and he was sentenced to
the hemlock cup. FOURTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AFTERWARD
AN ENTHUSIAST APPEALED TO THE POPULAR MOB and all
Europe plunged into the Holy Land to kill and mangle the heathen.
In the seventeenth century a demagog appealed to the ignorance of
men AND TWENTY PEOPLE WERE EXECUTED AT SALEM,
MASS., WITHIN SIX MONTHS FOR WITCHCRAFT. Two
thousand years ago the mob yelled, "RELEASE UNTO US
BARABBAS"—AND BARABBAS WAS A MURDERER!

_Change of Tempo Produces Emphasis_

Any big change of tempo is emphatic and will catch the attention. You may
scarcely be conscious that a passenger train is moving when it is flying over the
rails at ninety miles an hour, but if it slows down very suddenly to a ten-mile gait

your attention will be drawn to it very decidedly. You may forget that you are
listening to music as you dine, but let the orchestra either increase or diminish its
tempo in a very marked degree and your attention will be arrested at once.

This same principle will procure emphasis in a speech. If you have a point that
you want to bring home to your audience forcefully, make a sudden and great
change of tempo, and they will be powerless to keep from paying attention to
that point. Recently the present writer saw a play in which these lines were
spoken:

"I don't want you to forget what I said. I want you to remember it the longest day
you—I don't care if you've got six guns." The part up to the dash was delivered
in a very slow tempo, the remainder was named out at lightning speed, as the
character who was spoken to drew a revolver. The effect was so emphatic that
the lines are remembered six months afterwards, while most of the play has
faded from memory. The student who has powers of observation will see this
principle applied by all our best actors in their efforts to get emphasis where
emphasis is due. But remember that the emotion in the matter must warrant the
intensity in the manner, or the effect will be ridiculous. Too many public
speakers are impressive over nothing.

Thought rather than rules must govern you while practising change of pace. It is
often a matter of no consequence which part of a sentence is spoken slowly and
which is given in fast tempo. The main thing to be desired is the change itself.
For example, in the selection, "The Mob," on page [^4]:[^6]:, note the last paragraph.
Reverse the instructions given, delivering everything that is marked for slow
tempo, quickly; and everything that is marked for quick tempo, slowly. You will
note that the force or meaning of the passage has not been destroyed.

However, many passages cannot be changed to a slow tempo without destroying
their force. Instances: The Patrick Henry speech on page [^1]:[^1]:[^0]:, and the following
passage from Whittier's "Barefoot Boy."

```
O for boyhood's time of June, crowding years in one brief moon,
when all things I heard or saw, me, their master, waited for. I was
rich in flowers and trees, humming-birds and honey-bees; for my
sport the squirrel played; plied the snouted mole his spade; for my
taste the blackberry cone purpled over hedge and stone; laughed the
brook for my delight through the day and through the night,
whispering at the garden wall, talked with me from fall to fall; mine
the sand-rimmed pickerel pond; mine the walnut slopes beyond;
mine, an bending orchard trees, apples of Hesperides! Still, as my
horizon grew, larger grew my riches, too; all the world I saw or
knew seemed a complex Chinese toy, fashioned for a barefoot boy!
—J.G. WHITTIER.
```

Be careful in regulating your tempo not to get your movement too fast. This is a
common fault with amateur speakers. Mrs. Siddons rule was, "Take time." A
hundred years ago there was used in medical circles a preparation known as "the
shot gun remedy;" it was a mixture of about fifty different ingredients, and was
given to the patient in the hope that at least one of them would prove efficacious!
That seems a rather poor scheme for medical practice, but it is good to use "shot
gun" tempo for most speeches, as it gives a variety. Tempo, like diet, is best
when mixed.

DEDICATION OF GETTYSBURG CEMETERY
```

```
Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this
continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a
great civil war, testing whether that nation—or any nation so
conceived and so dedicated—can long endure.
```

```
We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We are met to dedicate
a portion of it as the final resting-place of those who have given their
lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper
that we should do this.
```

```
But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we
cannot hallow, this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who
struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our power to add or to
detract. The world will very little note nor long remember what we
say here; but it can never forget what they did here.
```

```
It is for us, the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished
work they have thus far so nobly carried on. It is rather for us to be
here dedicated to the great task remaining before us: that from these
honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which
they here gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly
resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that the nation
shall, under God, have a new birth of freedom, and that government
of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the
earth.

A PLEA FOR CUBA
```

[This deliberative oration was delivered by Senator Thurston in the United States Senate on
March [^2]:[^4]:, [^1]:[^8]:[^9]:[^8]:. It is recorded in full in the _Congressional Record_ of that date. Mrs.
Thurston died in Cuba. As a dying request she urged her husband, who was investigating
affairs in the island, to do his utmost to induce the United States to intervene—hence this
oration.]

Mr. President, I am here by command of silent lips to speak once
and for all upon the Cuban situation. I shall endeavor to be honest,
conservative, and just. I have no purpose to stir the public passion to
any action not necessary and imperative to meet the duties and
necessities of American responsibility, Christian humanity, and
national honor. I would shirk this task if I could, but I dare not. I
cannot satisfy my conscience except by speaking, and speaking now.

I went to Cuba firmly believing that the condition of affairs there
had been greatly exaggerated by the press, and my own efforts were
directed in the first instance to the attempted exposure of these
supposed exaggerations. There has undoubtedly been much
sensationalism in the journalism of the time, but as to the condition
of affairs in Cuba, there has been no exaggeration, because
exaggeration has been impossible.

Under the inhuman policy of Weyler not less than four hundred
thousand self-supporting, simple, peaceable, defenseless country
people were driven from their homes in the agricultural portions of
the Spanish provinces to the cities, and imprisoned upon the barren
waste outside the residence portions of these cities and within the
lines of intrenchment established a little way beyond. Their humble
homes were burned, their fields laid waste, their implements of
husbandry destroyed, their live stock and food supplies for the most
part confiscated. Most of the people were old men, women, and
children. They were thus placed in hopeless imprisonment, without
shelter or food. There was no work for them in the cities to which
they were driven. They were left with nothing to depend upon
except the scanty charity of the inhabitants of the cities and with
slow starvation their inevitable fate....

The pictures in the American newspapers of the starving
reconcentrados are true. They can all be duplicated by the thousands.
I never before saw, and please God I may never again see, so
deplorable a sight as the reconcentrados in the suburbs of Matanzas.

I can never forget to my dying day the hopeless anguish in their
despairing eyes. Huddled about their little bark huts, they raised no
voice of appeal to us for alms as we went among them....

Men, women, and children stand silent, famishing with hunger.
Their only appeal comes from their sad eyes, through which one
looks as through an open window into their agonizing souls.

The government of Spain has not appropriated and will not
appropriate one dollar to save these people. They are now being
attended and nursed and administered to by the charity of the United
States. Think of the spectacle! We are feeding these citizens of
Spain; we are nursing their sick; we are saving such as can be saved,
and yet there are those who still say it is right for us to send food,
but we must keep hands off. I say that the time has come when
muskets ought to go with the food.

We asked the governor if he knew of any relief for these people
except through the charity of the United States. He did not. We
asked him, "When do you think the time will come that these people
can be placed in a position of self-support?" He replied to us, with
deep feeling, "Only the good God or the great government of the
United States will answer that question." I hope and believe that the
good God by the great government of the United States will answer
that question.

I shall refer to these horrible things no further. They are there. God
pity me, I have seen them; they will remain in my mind forever—
and this is almost the twentieth century. Christ died nineteen
hundred years ago, and Spain is a Christian nation. She has set up
more crosses in more lands, beneath more skies, and under them has
butchered more people than all the other nations of the earth
combined. Europe may tolerate her existence as long as the people
of the Old World wish. God grant that before another Christmas
morning the last vestige of Spanish tyranny and oppression will have
vanished from the Western Hemisphere!...

The time for action has come. No greater reason for it can exist to-
morrow than exists to-day. Every hour's delay only adds another
chapter to the awful story of misery and death. Only one power can

intervene—the United States of America. Ours is the one great
nation in the world, the mother of American republics. She holds a
position of trust and responsibility toward the peoples and affairs of
the whole Western Hemisphere. It was her glorious example which
inspired the patriots of Cuba to raise the flag of liberty in her eternal
hills. We cannot refuse to accept this responsibility which the God of
the universe has placed upon us as the one great power in the New
World. We must act! What shall our action be?

Against the intervention of the United States in this holy cause there
is but one voice of dissent; that voice is the voice of the money-
changers. They fear war! Not because of any Christian or ennobling
sentiment against war and in favor of peace, but because they fear
that a declaration of war, or the intervention which might result in
war, would have a depressing effect upon the stock market. Let them
go. They do not represent American sentiment; they do not represent
American patriotism. Let them take their chances as they can. Their
weal or woe is of but little importance to the liberty-loving people of
the United States. They will not do the fighting; their blood will not
flow; they will keep on dealing in options on human life. Let the
men whose loyalty is to the dollar stand aside while the men whose
loyalty is to the flag come to the front.

Mr. President, there is only one action possible, if any is taken; that
is, intervention for the independence of the island. But we cannot
intervene and save Cuba without the exercise of force, and force
means war; war means blood. The lowly Nazarene on the shores of
Galilee preached the divine doctrine of love, "Peace on earth, good
will toward men." Not peace on earth at the expense of liberty and
humanity. Not good will toward men who despoil, enslave, degrade,
and starve to death their fellow-men. I believe in the doctrine of
Christ. I believe in the doctrine of peace; but, Mr. President, men
must have liberty before there can come abiding peace.

Intervention means force. Force means war. War means blood. But it
will be God's force. When has a battle for humanity and liberty ever
been won except by force? What barricade of wrong, injustice, and
oppression has ever been carried except by force?

Force compelled the signature of unwilling royalty to the great

Magna Charta; force put life into the Declaration of Independence
and made effective the Emancipation Proclamation; force beat with
naked hands upon the iron gateway of the Bastile and made reprisal
in one awful hour for centuries of kingly crime; force waved the flag
of revolution over Bunker Hill and marked the snows of Valley
Forge with blood-stained feet; force held the broken line of Shiloh,
climbed the flame-swept hill at Chattanooga, and stormed the clouds
on Lookout Heights; force marched with Sherman to the sea, rode
with Sheridan in the valley of the Shenandoah, and gave Grant
victory at Appomattox; force saved the Union, kept the stars in the
flag, made "niggers" men. The time for God's force has come again.
Let the impassioned lips of American patriots once more take up the
song:—

```
"In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born
across the sea.
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures
you and me;
As He died to make men holy, let us die to
make men free.
While God is marching on."
```

Others may hesitate, others may procrastinate, others may plead for
further diplomatic negotiation, which means delay; but for me, I am
ready to act now, and for my action I am ready to answer to my
conscience, my country, and my God.

```
PAUSE AND POWER
```

The true business of the literary artist is to plait or weave his
meaning, involving it around itself; so that each sentence, by
successive phrases, shall first come into a kind of knot, and then,

```
after a moment of suspended meaning, solve and clear itself.
```

```
—GEORGE SAINTSBURY, on English Prose
Style, in Miscellaneous Essays.
```

... pause... has a distinctive value, expressed in silence; in other
words, while the voice is waiting, the music of the movement is
going on... To manage it, with its delicacies and compensations,
requires that same fineness of ear on which we must depend for all
faultless prose rhythm. When there is no compensation, when the
pause is inadvertent... there is a sense of jolting and lack, as if some
pin or fastening had fallen out.

```
—JOHN FRANKLIN GENUNG, The Working Principles of Rhetoric.
```

Pause, in public speech, is not mere silence—it is silence made designedly
eloquent.

When a man says: "I-uh-it is with profound-ah-pleasure that-er-I have been
permitted to speak to you tonight and-uh-uh-I should say-er"—that is not
pausing; that is stumbling. It is conceivable that a speaker may be effective in
spite of stumbling—but never because of it.

On the other hand, one of the most important means of developing power in
public speaking is to pause either before or after, or both before and after, an
important word or phrase. No one who would be a forceful speaker can afford to
neglect this principle—one of the most significant that has ever been inferred
from listening to great orators. Study this potential device until you have
absorbed and assimilated it.

It would seem that this principle of rhetorical pause ought to be easily grasped
and applied, but a long experience in training both college men and maturer
speakers has demonstrated that the device is no more readily understood by the
average man when it is first explained to him than if it were spoken in
Hindoostani. Perhaps this is because we do not eagerly devour the fruit of
experience when it is impressively set before us on the platter of authority; we
like to pluck fruit for ourselves—it not only tastes better, but we never forget
that tree! Fortunately, this is no difficult task, in this instance, for the trees stand
thick all about us.

One man is pleading the cause of another:

```
"This man, my friends, has made this wonderful sacrifice—for you
and me."
```

Did not the pause surprisingly enhance the power of this statement? See how he
gathered up reserve force and impressiveness to deliver the words "for you and
me." Repeat this passage without making a pause. Did it lose in effectiveness?

Naturally enough, during a premeditated pause of this kind the mind of the
speaker is concentrated on the thought to which he is about to give expression.
He will not dare to allow his thoughts to wander for an instant—he will rather
supremely center his thought and his emotion upon the sacrifice whose service,
sweetness and divinity he is enforcing by his appeal.

_Concentration_, then, is the big word here—no pause without it can perfectly hit
the mark.

Efficient pausing accomplishes one or all of four results:

[^1]:_. Pause Enables the Mind of the Speaker to Gather His Forces Before_
_Delivering the Final Volley_

It is often dangerous to rush into battle without pausing for preparation or
waiting for recruits. Consider Custer's massacre as an instance.

You can light a match by holding it beneath a lens and concentrating the sun's
rays. You would not expect the match to flame if you jerked the lens back and
forth quickly. Pause, and the lens gathers the heat. Your thoughts will not set fire
to the minds of your hearers unless you pause to gather the force that comes by a
second or two of concentration. Maple trees and gas wells are rarely tapped
continually; when a stronger flow is wanted, a pause is made, nature has time to
gather her reserve forces, and when the tree or the well is reopened, a stronger
flow is the result.

Use the same common sense with your mind. If you would make a thought
particularly effective, pause just before its utterance, concentrate your mind-
energies, and then give it expression with renewed vigor. Carlyle was right:
"Speak not, I passionately entreat thee, till thy thought has silently matured
itself. Out of silence comes thy strength. Speech is silvern, Silence is golden;
Speech is human, Silence is divine."

Silence has been called the father of speech. It should be. Too many of our
public speeches have no fathers. They ramble along without pause or break. Like

Tennyson's brook, they run on forever. Listen to little children, the policeman on
the corner, the family conversation around the table, and see how many pauses
they naturally use, for they are unconscious of effects. When we get before an
audience, we throw most of our natural methods of expression to the wind, and
strive after artificial effects. Get back to the methods of nature—and pause.

[^2]:_. Pause Prepares the Mind of the Auditor to Receive Your Message_

Herbert Spencer said that all the universe is in motion. So it is—and all perfect
motion is rhythm. Part of rhythm is rest. Rest follows activity all through nature.
Instances: day and night; spring—summer—autumn—winter; a period of rest
between breaths; an instant of complete rest between heart beats. Pause, and give
the attention-powers of your audience a rest. What you say after such a silence
will then have a great deal more effect.

When your country cousins come to town, the noise of a passing car will awaken
them, though it seldom affects a seasoned city dweller. By the continual passing
of cars his attention-power has become deadened. In one who visits the city but
seldom, attention-value is insistent. To him the noise comes after a long pause;
hence its power. To you, dweller in the city, there is no pause; hence the low
attention-value. After riding on a train several hours you will become so
accustomed to its roar that it will lose its attention-value, unless the train should
stop for a while and start again. If you attempt to listen to a clock-tick that is so
far away that you can barely hear it, you will find that at times you are unable to
distinguish it, but in a few moments the sound becomes distinct again. Your
mind will pause for rest whether you desire it to do so or not.

The attention of your audience will act in quite the same way. Recognize this law
and prepare for it—by pausing. Let it be repeated: the thought that follows a
pause is much more dynamic than if no pause had occurred. What is said to you
of a night will not have the same effect on your mind as if it had been uttered in
the morning when your attention had been lately refreshed by the pause of sleep.
We are told on the first page of the Bible that even the Creative Energy of God
rested on the "seventh day." You may be sure, then, that the frail finite mind of
your audience will likewise demand rest. Observe nature, study her laws, and
obey them in your speaking.

[^3]:_. Pause Creates Effective Suspense_

Suspense is responsible for a great share of our interest in life; it will be the same
with your speech. A play or a novel is often robbed of much of its interest if you

know the plot beforehand. We like to keep guessing as to the outcome. The
ability to create suspense is part of woman's power to hold the other sex. The
circus acrobat employs this principle when he fails purposely in several attempts
to perform a feat, and then achieves it. Even the deliberate manner in which he
arranges the preliminaries increases our expectation—we like to be kept waiting.
In the last act of the play, "Polly of the Circus," there is a circus scene in which a
little dog turns a backward somersault on the back of a running pony. One night
when he hesitated and had to be coaxed and worked with a long time before he
would perform his feat he got a great deal more applause than when he did his
trick at once. We not only like to wait but we appreciate what we wait for. If fish
bite too readily the sport soon ceases to be a sport.

It is this same principle of suspense that holds you in a Sherlock Holmes story—
you wait to see how the mystery is solved, and if it is solved too soon you throw
down the tale unfinished. Wilkie Collins' receipt for fiction writing well applies
to public speech: "Make 'em laugh; make 'em weep; make 'em wait." Above all
else make them wait; if they will not do that you may be sure they will neither
laugh nor weep.

Thus pause is a valuable instrument in the hands of a trained speaker to arouse
and maintain suspense. We once heard Mr. Bryan say in a speech: "It was my
privilege to hear"—and he paused, while the audience wondered for a second
whom it was his privilege to hear—"the great evangelist"—and he paused again;
we knew a little more about the man he had heard, but still wondered to which
evangelist he referred; and then he concluded: "Dwight L. Moody." Mr. Bryan
paused slightly again and continued: "I came to regard him"—here he paused
again and held the audience in a brief moment of suspense as to how he had
regarded Mr. Moody, then continued—"as the greatest preacher of his day." Let
the dashes illustrate pauses and we have the following:

```
"It was my privilege to hear—the great evangelist—Dwight L.
Moody.—I came to regard him—as the greatest preacher of his day."
```

The unskilled speaker would have rattled this off with neither pause nor
suspense, and the sentences would have fallen flat upon the audience. It is
precisely the application of these small things that makes much of the difference
between the successful and the unsuccessful speaker.

[^4]:_. Pausing After An Important Idea Gives it Time to Penetrate_

Any Missouri farmer will tell you that a rain that falls too fast will run off into

the creeks and do the crops but little good. A story is told of a country deacon
praying for rain in this manner: "Lord, don't send us any chunk floater. Just give
us a good old drizzle-drazzle." A speech, like a rain, will not do anybody much
good if it comes too fast to soak in. The farmer's wife follows this same principle
in doing her washing when she puts the clothes in water—and pauses for several
hours that the water may soak in. The physician puts cocaine on your turbinates
—and pauses to let it take hold before he removes them. Why do we use this
principle everywhere except in the communication of ideas? If you have given
the audience a big idea, pause for a second or two and let them turn it over. See
what effect it has. After the smoke clears away you may have to fire another [^1]:[^4]:-
inch shell on the same subject before you demolish the citadel of error that you
are trying to destroy. Take time. Don't let your speech resemble those tourists
who try "to do" New York in a day. They spend fifteen minutes looking at the
masterpieces in the Metropolitan Museum of Arts, ten minutes in the Museum of
Natural History, take a peep into the Aquarium, hurry across the Brooklyn
Bridge, rush up to the Zoo, and back by Grant's Tomb—and call that "Seeing
New York." If you hasten by your important points without pausing, your
audience will have just about as adequate an idea of what you have tried to
convey.

Take time, you have just as much of it as our richest multimillionaire. Your
audience will wait for you. It is a sign of smallness to hurry. The great redwood
trees of California had burst through the soil five hundred years before Socrates
drank his cup of hemlock poison, and are only in their prime today. Nature
shames us with our petty haste. Silence is one of the most eloquent things in the
world. Master it, and use it through pause.

In the following selections dashes have been inserted where pauses may be used
effectively. Naturally, you may omit some of these and insert others without
going wrong—one speaker would interpret a passage in one way, one in another;
it is largely a matter of personal preference. A dozen great actors have played
Hamlet well, and yet each has played the part differently. Which comes the
nearest to perfection is a question of opinion. You will succeed best by daring to
follow your own course—if you are individual enough to blaze an original trail.

```
A moment's halt—a momentary taste of being from the well amid
the waste—and lo! the phantom caravan has reached—the nothing it
```

```
set out from—Oh make haste!
```

```
The worldly hope men set their hearts upon—turns ashes—or it
prospers;—and anon like snow upon the desert's dusty face—
lighting a little hour or two—is gone.
```

```
The bird of time has but a little way to flutter,—and the bird is on
the wing.
```

You will note that the punctuation marks have nothing to do with the pausing.
You may run by a period very quickly and make a long pause where there is no
kind of punctuation. Thought is greater than punctuation. It must guide you in
your pauses.

```
A book of verses underneath the bough,—a jug of wine, a loaf of
bread—and thou beside me singing in the wilderness—Oh—
wilderness were paradise enow.
```

You must not confuse the pause for emphasis with the natural pauses that come
through taking breath and phrasing. For example, note the pauses indicated in
this selection from Byron:

```
But hush!—hark!—that deep sound breaks in once more,
And nearer!—clearer!—deadlier than before.
Arm, ARM!—it is—it is the cannon's opening roar!
```

It is not necessary to dwell at length upon these obvious distinctions. You will
observe that in natural conversation our words are gathered into clusters or
phrases, and we often pause to take breath between them. So in public speech,
breathe naturally and do not talk until you must gasp for breath; nor until the
audience is equally winded.

A serious word of caution must here be uttered: do not overwork the pause. To
do so will make your speech heavy and stilted. And do not think that pause can
transmute commonplace thoughts into great and dignified utterance. A grand
manner combined with insignificant ideas is like harnessing a Hambletonian
with an ass. You remember the farcical old school declamation, "A Midnight
Murder," that proceeded in grandiose manner to a thrilling climax, and ended
—"and relentlessly murdered—a mosquito!"

The pause, dramatically handled, always drew a laugh from the tolerant hearers.

This is all very well in farce, but such anti-climax becomes painful when the
speaker falls from the sublime to the ridiculous quite unintentionally. The pause,
to be effective in some other manner than in that of the boomerang, must precede
or follow a thought that is really worth while, or at least an idea whose bearing
upon the rest of the speech is important.

William Pittenger relates in his volume, "Extempore Speech," an instance of the
unconsciously farcical use of the pause by a really great American statesman and
orator. "He had visited Niagara Falls and was to make an oration at Buffalo the
same day, but, unfortunately, he sat too long over the wine after dinner. When he
arose to speak, the oratorical instinct struggled with difficulties, as he declared,
'Gentlemen, I have been to look upon your mag—mag—magnificent cataract,
one hundred—and forty—seven—feet high! Gentlemen, Greece and Rome in
their palmiest days never had a cataract one hundred—and forty—seven—feet
high!'"

with flowers. We lose sight of them no more. We are with them
when they enlist in the great army of freedom. We see them part
from those they love. Some are walking for the last time in quiet
woody places with the maiden they adore. We hear the whisperings
and the sweet vows of eternal love as they lingeringly part forever.
Others are bending over cradles, kissing babies that are asleep. Some
are receiving the blessings of old men. Some are parting from those
who hold them and press them to their hearts again and again, and
say nothing; and some are talking with wives, and endeavoring with
brave words spoken in the old tones to drive from their hearts the
awful fear. We see them part. We see the wife standing in the door,
with the babe in her arms—standing in the sunlight sobbing; at the
turn of the road a hand waves—she answers by holding high in her
loving hands the child. He is gone—and forever.

```
The history of womankind is a story of abuse. For ages men beat,
sold, and abused their wives and daughters like cattle. The Spartan
mother that gave birth to one of her own sex disgraced herself; the
girl babies were often deserted in the mountains to starve; China
bound and deformed their feet; Turkey veiled their faces; America
denied them equal educational advantages with men. Most of the
world still refuses them the right to participate in the government
and everywhere women bear the brunt of an unequal standard of
morality.

But the women are on the march. They are walking upward to the

THE IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT
```

... At last, the Republican party has appeared. It avows, now, as the
Republican party of 1800 did, in one word, its faith and its works,
"Equal and exact justice to all men." Even when it first entered the
field, only half organized, it struck a blow which only just failed to
secure complete and triumphant victory. In this, its second
campaign, it has already won advantages which render that triumph
now both easy and certain. The secret of its assured success lies in
that very characteristic which, in the mouth of scoffers, constitutes
its great and lasting imbecility and reproach. It lies in the fact that it
is a party of one idea; but that is a noble one—an idea that fills and
expands all generous souls; the idea of equality of all men before
human tribunals and human laws, as they all are equal before the
Divine tribunal and Divine laws.

```
I know, and you know, that a revolution has begun. I know, and all
the world knows, that revolutions never go backward. Twenty
senators and a hundred representatives proclaim boldly in Congress
to-day sentiments and opinions and principles of freedom which
hardly so many men, even in this free State, dared to utter in their
own homes twenty years ago. While the government of the United
States, under the conduct of the Democratic party, has been all that
time surrendering one plain and castle after another to slavery, the
people of the United States have been no less steadily and
perseveringly gathering together the forces with which to recover
back again all the fields and all the castles which have been lost, and
to confound and overthrow, by one decisive blow, the betrayers of
the Constitution and freedom forever.—W.H. SEWARD.

CHAPTER VII
```

```
EFFICIENCY THROUGH INFLECTION
```

```
How soft the music of those village bells,
Falling at intervals upon the ear
In cadence sweet; now dying all away,
Now pealing loud again, and louder still,
Clear and sonorous, as the gale comes on!
With easy force it opens all the cells
Where Memory slept.
```

```
—WILLIAM COWPER, The Task.
```

Herbert Spencer remarked that "Cadence"—by which he meant the modulation
of the tones of the voice in speaking—"is the running commentary of the
emotions upon the propositions of the intellect." How true this is will appear
when we reflect that the little upward and downward shadings of the voice tell
more truly what we mean than our words. The expressiveness of language is
literally multiplied by this subtle power to shade the vocal tones, and this voice-
shading we call _inflection_.

The change of pitch _within_ a word is even more important, because more
delicate, than the change of pitch from phrase to phrase. Indeed, one cannot be
practised without the other. The bare words are only so many bricks—inflection
will make of them a pavement, a garage, or a cathedral. It is the power of
inflection to change the meaning of words that gave birth to the old saying: "It is
not so much what you say, as how you say it."

Mrs. Jameson, the Shakespearean commentator, has given us a penetrating
example of the effect of inflection; "In her impersonation of the part of Lady
Macbeth, Mrs. Siddons adopted successively three different intonations in giving
the words 'We fail.' At first a quick contemptuous interrogation—'We fail?'
Afterwards, with the note of admiration—'We fail,' an accent of indignant

astonishment laying the principal emphasis on the word 'we'—'_we_ fail.' Lastly,
she fixed on what I am convinced is the true reading—_We fail_—with the simple
period, modulating the voice to a deep, low, resolute tone which settles the issue
at once as though she had said: 'If we fail, why then we fail, and all is over.'"

This most expressive element of our speech is the last to be mastered in attaining
to naturalness in speaking a foreign language, and its correct use is the main
element in a natural, flexible utterance of our native tongue. Without varied
inflections speech becomes wooden and monotonous.

There are but two kinds of inflection, the rising and the falling, yet these two
may be so shaded or so combined that they are capable of producing as many
varieties of modulation as maybe illustrated by either one or two lines, straight
or curved, thus:

```
lines
```

```
Sharp rising
```

```
Long rising
```

```
Level
```

```
Long falling
```

```
Sharp falling
```

```
Sharp rising and falling
```

```
Sharp falling and rising
```

```
Hesitating
```

These may be varied indefinitely, and serve merely to illustrate what wide
varieties of combination may be effected by these two simple inflections of the
voice.

It is impossible to tabulate the various inflections which serve to express various
shades of thought and feeling. A few suggestions are offered here, together with
abundant exercises for practise, but the only real way to master inflection is to

observe, experiment, and practise.

For example, take the common sentence, "Oh, he's all right." Note how a rising
inflection may be made to express faint praise, or polite doubt, or uncertainty of
opinion. Then note how the same words, spoken with a generally falling
inflection may denote certainty, or good-natured approval, or enthusiastic praise,
and so on.

In general, then, we find that a bending upward of the voice will suggest doubt
and uncertainty, while a decided falling inflection will suggest that you are
certain of your ground.

Students dislike to be told that their speeches are "not so bad," spoken with a
rising inflection. To enunciate these words with a long falling inflection would
indorse the speech rather heartily.

Say good-bye to an imaginary person whom you expect to see again tomorrow;
then to a dear friend you never expect to meet again. Note the difference in
inflection.

"I have had a delightful time," when spoken at the termination of a formal tea by
a frivolous woman takes altogether different inflection than the same words
spoken between lovers who have enjoyed themselves. Mimic the two characters
in repeating this and observe the difference.

Note how light and short the inflections are in the following brief quotation from
"Anthony the Absolute," by Samuel Mervin.

```
At Sea—March 28th.
```

```
This evening I told Sir Robert What's His Name he was a fool.
```

```
I was quite right in this. He is.
```

```
Every evening since the ship left Vancouver he has presided over the
round table in the middle of the smoking-room. There he sips his
coffee and liqueur, and holds forth on every subject known to the
mind of man. Each subject is his subject. He is an elderly person,
with a bad face and a drooping left eyelid.
```

```
They tell me that he is in the British Service—a judge somewhere
down in Malaysia, where they drink more than is good for them.
```

Deliver the two following selections with great earnestness, and note how the
inflections differ from the foregoing. Then reread these selections in a light,
superficial manner, noting that the change of attitude is expressed through a
change of inflection.

```
When I read a sublime fact in Plutarch, or an unselfish deed in a line
of poetry, or thrill beneath some heroic legend, it is no longer
fairyland—I have seen it matched.—WENDELL PHILLIPS.
```

```
Thought is deeper than all speech,
Feeling deeper than all thought;
Souls to souls can never teach
What unto themselves was taught.
```

```
—CRANCH
```

It must be made perfectly clear that inflection deals mostly in subtle, delicate
shading _within single words_, and is not by any means accomplished by a general
rise or fall in the voice in speaking a sentence. Yet certain sentences may be
effectively delivered with just such inflection. Try this sentence in several ways,
making no modulation until you come to the last two syllables, as indicated,

```
And yet I told him dis-
```

--------------------------
(high) |
| tinctly.
-------------------------
(low)
tinctly.
-------------------------
| (high)
And yet I told him dis- |
-------------------------
(low)

Now try this sentence by inflecting the important words so as to bring out
various shades of meaning. The first forms, illustrated above, show change of
pitch _within a single word_; the forms you will work out for yourself should show

a number of such inflections throughout the sentence.

One of the chief means of securing emphasis is to employ a long falling
inflection on the emphatic words—that is, to let the voice fall to a lower pitch on
an _interior_ vowel sound in a word. Try it on the words "every," "eleemosynary,"
and "destroy."

Use long falling inflections on the italicized words in the following selection,
noting their emphatic power. Are there any other words here that long falling
inflections would help to make expressive?

```
ADDRESS IN THE DARTMOUTH COLLEGE CASE
```

```
This, sir, is my case. It is the case not merely of that humble
institution; it is the case of every college in our land. It is more; it is
the case of every eleemosynary institution throughout our country—
of all those great charities founded by the piety of our ancestors to
alleviate human misery and scatter blessings along the pathway of
life. Sir, you may destroy this little institution—it is weak, it is in
your hands. I know it is one of the lesser lights in the literary horizon
of our country. You may put it out. But if you do you must carry
through your work; you must extinguish, one after another, all those
great lights of science which, for more than a century, have thrown
their radiance over our land!
```

```
It is, sir, as I have said, a small college, and yet—there are those who
love it!
```

```
Sir, I know not how others may feel, but as for myself when I see
my alma mater surrounded, like Cæsar in the senate house, by those
who are reiterating stab after stab, I would not for this right hand
have her turn to me and say, And thou, too, my son!
```

```
—DANIEL WEBSTER.
```

Be careful not to over-inflect. Too much modulation produces an unpleasant
effect of artificiality, like a mature matron trying to be kittenish. It is a short step
between true expression and unintentional burlesque. Scrutinize your own tones.
Take a single expression like "Oh, no!" or "Oh, I see," or "Indeed," and by
patient self-examination see how many shades of meaning may be expressed by
inflection. This sort of common-sense practise will do you more good than a
book of rules. _But don't forget to listen to your own voice._

[^1]:[^5]:. Try the effects of both rising and falling inflections on the italicized words in
the following sentences. State your preference.

It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.
```

```
SELECTIONS FOR PRACTISE
```

In the following selections secure emphasis by means of long falling inflections
rather than loudness.

Repeat these selections, attempting to put into practise all the technical
principles that we have thus far had; emphasizing important words,
subordinating unimportant words, variety of pitch, changing tempo, pause, and
inflection. If these principles are applied you will have no trouble with
monotony.

Constant practise will give great facility in the use of inflection and will render
the voice itself flexible.

CHARLES I
```

```
We charge him with having broken his coronation oath; and we are
told that he kept his marriage vow! We accuse him of having given
up his people to the merciless inflictions of the most hot-headed and
hard-hearted of prelates; and the defence is, that he took his little son
on his knee and kissed him! We censure him for having violated the
articles of the Petition of Right, after having, for good and valuable
consideration, promised to observe them; and we are informed that
he was accustomed to hear prayers at six o'clock in the morning! It
is to such considerations as these, together with his Vandyke dress,
his handsome face, and his peaked beard, that he owes, we verily
believe, most of his popularity with the present generation.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN
```

```
We needed not that he should put on paper that he believed in
slavery, who, with treason, with murder, with cruelty infernal,
hovered around that majestic man to destroy his life. He was himself
but the long sting with which slavery struck at liberty; and he carried
the poison that belonged to slavery. As long as this nation lasts, it
will never be forgotten that we have one martyred President—never!
Never, while time lasts, while heaven lasts, while hell rocks and
groans, will it be forgotten that slavery, by its minions, slew him,
and in slaying him made manifest its whole nature and tendency.
```

```
But another thing for us to remember is that this blow was aimed at
the life of the government and of the nation. Lincoln was slain;
America was meant. The man was cast down; the government was
smitten at. It was the President who was killed. It was national life,
```

breathing freedom and meaning beneficence, that was sought. He,
the man of Illinois, the private man, divested of robes and the
insignia of authority, representing nothing but his personal self,
might have been hated; but that would not have called forth the
murderer's blow. It was because he stood in the place of government,
representing government and a government that represented right
and liberty, that he was singled out.

This, then, is a crime against universal government. It is not a blow
at the foundations of our government, more than at the foundations
of the English government, of the French government, of every
compact and well-organized government. It was a crime against
mankind. The whole world will repudiate and stigmatize it as a deed
without a shade of redeeming light....

The blow, however, has signally failed. The cause is not stricken; it
is strengthened. This nation has dissolved,—but in tears only. It
stands, four-square, more solid, to-day, than any pyramid in Egypt.
This people are neither wasted, nor daunted, nor disordered. Men
hate slavery and love liberty with stronger hate and love to-day than
ever before. The Government is not weakened, it is made stronger....

And now the martyr is moving in triumphal march, mightier than
when alive. The nation rises up at every stage of his coming. Cities
and states are his pall-bearers, and the cannon beats the hours with
solemn progression. Dead—dead—dead—he yet speaketh! Is
Washington dead? Is Hampden dead? Is David dead? Is any man
dead that ever was fit to live? Disenthralled of flesh, and risen to the
unobstructed sphere where passion never comes, he begins his
illimitable work. His life now is grafted upon the Infinite, and will
be fruitful as no earthly life can be. Pass on, thou that hast
overcome! Your sorrows O people, are his peace! Your bells, and
bands, and muffled drums sound triumph in his ear. Wail and weep
here; God makes it echo joy and triumph there. Pass on, victor!

Four years ago, O Illinois, we took from your midst an untried man,
and from among the people; we return him to you a mighty
conqueror. Not thine any more, but the nation's; not ours, but the
world's. Give him place, ye prairies! In the midst of this great
Continent his dust shall rest, a sacred treasure to myriads who shall

make pilgrimage to that shrine to kindle anew their zeal and
patriotism. Ye winds, that move over the mighty places of the West,
chant his requiem! Ye people, behold a martyr, whose blood, as so
many inarticulate words, pleads for fidelity, for law, for liberty!
—HENRY WARD BEECHER.

THE HISTORY OF LIBERTY
```

The event which we commemorate is all-important, not merely in
our own annals, but in those of the world. The sententious English
poet has declared that "the proper study of mankind is man," and of
all inquiries of a temporal nature, the history of our fellow-beings is
unquestionably among the most interesting. But not all the chapters
of human history are alike important. The annals of our race have
been filled up with incidents which concern not, or at least ought not
to concern, the great company of mankind. History, as it has often
been written, is the genealogy of princes, the field-book of
conquerors; and the fortunes of our fellow-men have been treated
only so far as they have been affected by the influence of the great
masters and destroyers of our race. Such history is, I will not say a
worthless study, for it is necessary for us to know the dark side as
well as the bright side of our condition. But it is a melancholy study
which fills the bosom of the philanthropist and the friend of liberty
with sorrow.

But the history of liberty—the history of men struggling to be free—
the history of men who have acquired and are exercising their
freedom—the history of those great movements in the world, by
which liberty has been established and perpetuated, forms a subject
which we cannot contemplate too closely. This is the real history of
man, of the human family, of rational immortal beings....

The trial of adversity was theirs; the trial of prosperity is ours. Let us
meet it as men who know their duty and prize their blessings. Our
position is the most enviable, the most responsible, which men can
fill. If this generation does its duty, the cause of constitutional
freedom is safe. If we fail—if we fail—not only do we defraud our
children of the inheritance which we received from our fathers, but
we blast the hopes of the friends of liberty throughout our continent,

```
throughout Europe, throughout the world, to the end of time.
```

```
History is not without her examples of hard-fought fields, where the
banner of liberty has floated triumphantly on the wildest storm of
battle. She is without her examples of a people by whom the dear-
bought treasure has been wisely employed and safely handed down.
The eyes of the world are turned for that example to us....
```

```
Let us, then, as we assemble on the birthday of the nation, as we
gather upon the green turf, once wet with precious blood—let us
devote ourselves to the sacred cause of constitutional liberty! Let us
abjure the interests and passions which divide the great family of
American freemen! Let the rage of party spirit sleep to-day! Let us
resolve that our children shall have cause to bless the memory of
their fathers, as we have cause to bless the memory of ours!

CHAPTER VIII
```

```
CONCENTRATION IN DELIVERY
```

```
Attention is the microscope of the mental eye. Its power may be high
or low; its field of view narrow or broad. When high power is used
attention is confined within very circumscribed limits, but its action
is exceedingly intense and absorbing. It sees but few things, but
these few are observed "through and through"... Mental energy and
activity, whether of perception or of thought, thus concentrated, act
like the sun's rays concentrated by the burning glass. The object is
illumined, heated, set on fire. Impressions are so deep that they can
never be effaced. Attention of this sort is the prime condition of the
most productive mental labor.
```

```
—DANIEL PUTNAM, Psychology.
```

Try to rub the top of your head forward and backward at the same time that you
are patting your chest. Unless your powers of coördination are well developed
you will find it confusing, if not impossible. The brain needs special training

before it can do two or more things efficiently at the same instant. It may seem
like splitting a hair between its north and northwest corner, but some
psychologists argue that _no_ brain can think two distinct thoughts, absolutely
simultaneously—that what seems to be simultaneous is really very rapid rotation
from the first thought to the second and back again, just as in the above-cited
experiment the attention must shift from one hand to the other until one or the
other movement becomes partly or wholly automatic.

Whatever is the psychological truth of this contention it is undeniable that the
mind measurably loses grip on one idea the moment the attention is projected
decidedly ahead to a second or a third idea.

A fault in public speakers that is as pernicious as it is common is that they try to
think of the succeeding sentence while still uttering the former, and in this way
their concentration trails off; in consequence, they start their sentences strongly
and end them weakly. In a well-prepared written speech the emphatic word
usually comes at one end of the sentence. But an emphatic word needs emphatic
expression, and this is precisely what it does not get when concentration flags by
leaping too soon to that which is next to be uttered. Concentrate all your mental
energies on the present sentence. Remember that the mind of your audience
follows yours very closely, and if you withdraw your attention from what you
are saying to what you are going to say, your audience will also withdraw theirs.
They may not do so consciously and deliberately, but they will surely cease to
give importance to the things that you yourself slight. It is fatal to either the actor
or the speaker to cross his bridges too soon.

Of course, all this is not to say that in the natural pauses of your speech you are
not to take swift forward surveys—they are as important as the forward look in
driving a motor car; the caution is of quite another sort: _while speaking one_
_sentence do not think of the sentence to follow_. Let it come from its proper
source—within yourself. You cannot deliver a broadside without concentrated
force—that is what produces the explosion. In preparation you store and
concentrate thought and feeling; in the pauses during delivery you swiftly look
ahead and gather yourself for effective attack; during the moments of actual
speech, _SPEAK—DON'T ANTICIPATE_. Divide your attention and you divide
your power.

This matter of the effect of the inner man upon the outer needs a further word
here, particularly as touching concentration.

"What do you read, my lord?" Hamlet replied, "Words. Words. Words." That is a
world-old trouble. The mechanical calling of words is not expression, by a long
stretch. Did you ever notice how hollow a memorized speech usually sounds?
You have listened to the ranting, mechanical cadence of inefficient actors,
lawyers and preachers. Their trouble is a mental one—they are not
concentratedly thinking thoughts that cause words to issue with sincerity and
conviction, but are merely enunciating word-sounds mechanically. Painful
experience alike to audience and to speaker! A parrot is equally eloquent. Again
let Shakespeare instruct us, this tune in the insincere prayer of the King,
Hamlet's uncle. He laments thus pointedly:

```
My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
```

The truth is, that as a speaker your words must be born again every time they are
spoken, then they will not suffer in their utterance, even though perforce
committed to memory and repeated, like Dr. Russell Conwell's lecture, "Acres of
Diamonds," five thousand times. Such speeches lose nothing by repetition for
the perfectly patent reason that they arise from concentrated thought and feeling
and not a mere necessity for saying something—which usually means anything,
and that, in turn, is tantamount to nothing. If the thought beneath your words is
warm, fresh, spontaneous, a part of your _self_, your utterance will have breath and
life. Words are only a result. Do not try to get the result without stimulating the
cause.

Do you ask _how_ to concentrate? Think of the word itself, and of its philological
brother, _concentric_. Think of how a lens gathers and concenters the rays of light
within a given circle. It centers them by a process of withdrawal. It may seem
like a harsh saying, but the man who cannot concentrate is either weak of will, a
nervous wreck, or has never learned what will-power is good for.

You must concentrate by resolutely withdrawing your attention from everything
else. If you concentrate your thought on a pain which may be afflicting you, that
pain will grow more intense. "Count your blessings" and they will multiply.
Center your thought on your strokes and your tennis play will gradually
improve. To concentrate is simply to attend to one thing, and attend to nothing
else. If you find that you cannot do that, there is something wrong—attend to
that first. Remove the cause and the symptom will disappear. Read the chapter
on "Will Power." Cultivate your will by willing and then doing, at all costs.
Concentrate—and you will win.

WAR!
```

```
The last of the savage instincts is war. The cave man's club made
law and procured food. Might decreed right. Warriors were saviours.
```

```
In Nazareth a carpenter laid down the saw and preached the
brotherhood of man. Twelve centuries afterwards his followers
marched to the Holy Land to destroy all who differed with them in
the worship of the God of Love. Triumphantly they wrote "In
Solomon's Porch and in his temple our men rode in the blood of the
Saracens up to the knees of their horses."
```

```
History is an appalling tale of war. In the seventeenth century
Germany, France, Sweden, and Spain warred for thirty years. At
Magdeburg 30,000 out of 36,000 were killed regardless of sex or
age. In Germany schools were closed for a third of a century, homes
```

burned, women outraged, towns demolished, and the untilled land
became a wilderness.

Two-thirds of Germany's property was destroyed and [^1]:[^8]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: of
her citizens were killed, because men quarrelled about the way to
glorify "The Prince of Peace." Marching through rain and snow,
sleeping on the ground, eating stale food or starving, contracting
diseases and facing guns that fire six hundred times a minute, for
fifty cents a day—this is the soldier's life.

At the window sits the widowed mother crying. Little children with
tearful faces pressed against the pane watch and wait. Their means
of livelihood, their home, their happiness is gone. Fatherless
children, broken-hearted women, sick, disabled and dead men—this
is the wage of war.

We spend more money preparing men to kill each other than we do
in teaching them to live. We spend more money building one
battleship than in the annual maintenance of all our state
universities. The financial loss resulting from destroying one
another's homes in the civil war would have built [^1]:[^5]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,000
houses, each costing $[^2]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:. We pray for love but prepare for hate.
We preach peace but equip for war.

Were half the power that fills the world with
terror,

War only defers a question. No issue will ever really be settled until
it is settled rightly. Like rival "gun gangs" in a back alley, the nations
of the world, through the bloody ages, have fought over their
differences. Denver cannot fight Chicago and Iowa cannot fight
Ohio. Why should Germany be permitted to fight France, or
Bulgaria fight Turkey?

When mankind rises above creeds, colors and countries, when we

of the earth will constitute an international police force to preserve
the peace and the dove will take the eagle's place.

The wages of war are the wages of sin, and the "wages of sin is

FORCE
```

```
However, 'tis expedient to be wary:
Indifference, certes, don't produce distress;
And rash enthusiasm in good society
Were nothing but a moral inebriety.
```

```
—BYRON, Don Juan.
```

You have attended plays that seemed fair, yet they did not move you, grip you.
In theatrical parlance, they failed to "get over," which means that their message
did not get over the foot-lights to the audience. There was no punch, no jab to
them—they had no force.

Of course, all this spells disaster, in big letters, not only in a stage production but
in any platform effort. Every such presentation exists solely for the audience,
and if it fails to hit them—and the expression is a good one—it has no excuse for
living; nor will it live long.

_What is Force?_

Some of our most obvious words open up secret meanings under scrutiny, and
this is one of them.

To begin with, we must recognize the distinction between inner and outer force.
The one is cause, the other effect. The one is spiritual, the other physical. In this

important particular, animate force differs from inanimate force—the power of
man, coming from within and expressing itself outwardly, is of another sort from
the force of Shimose powder, which awaits some influence from without to
explode it. However susceptive to outside stimuli, the true source of power in
man lies within himself. This may seem like "mere psychology," but it has an
intensely practical bearing on public speaking, as will appear.

Not only must we discern the difference between human force and mere physical
force, but we must not confuse its real essence with some of the things that may
—and may not—accompany it. For example, loudness is not force, though force
at times may be attended by noise. Mere roaring never made a good speech, yet
there are moments—moments, mind you, not minutes—when big voice power
may be used with tremendous effect.

Nor is violent motion force—yet force may result in violent motion. Hamlet
counseled the players:

```
Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus; but use all
gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind
of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance, that may
give it smoothness. Oh, it offends me to the soul, to hear a
robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very
rags, to split the ears of the groundlings[[^2]]; who, for the most part,
are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb show, and noise. I
would have such a fellow whipped for o'er-doing Termagant; it out-
herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
```

```
Be not too tame, neither, but let your discretion be your tutor: suit
the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special
observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature; for anything
so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
first, and now, was, and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to
Nature, to show Virtue her own feature, Scorn her own image, and
the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now, this
overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskillful laugh,
cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one
must, in your allowance, o'erweigh a whole theater of others. Oh,
there be players that I have seen play—and heard others praise, and
that highly—not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent
of Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, or man, have so
```

```
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
humanity so abominably.[[^3]]
```

Force is both a cause and an effect. Inner force, which must precede outer force,
is a combination of four elements, acting progressively. First of all, _force arises_
_from conviction_. You must be convinced of the truth, or the importance, or the
meaning, of what you are about to say before you can give it forceful delivery. It
must lay strong hold upon your convictions before it can grip your audience.
Conviction convinces.

_The Saturday Evening Post_ in an article on "England's T.R."—Winston Spencer
Churchill—attributed much of Churchill's and Roosevelt's public platform
success to their forceful delivery. No matter what is in hand, these men make
themselves believe for the time being that that one thing is the most important on
earth. Hence they speak to their audiences in a Do-this-or-you-_PERISH_ manner.

That kind of speaking wins, and it is that virile, strenuous, aggressive attitude
which both distinguishes and maintains the platform careers of our greatest
leaders.

But let us look a little closer at the origins of inner force. How does conviction
affect the man who feels it? We have answered the inquiry in the very question
itself—he _feels_ it: _Conviction produces emotional tension_. Study the pictures of
Theodore Roosevelt and of Billy Sunday in action—_action_ is the word. Note the
tension of their jaw muscles, the taut lines of sinews in their entire bodies when
reaching a climax of force. Moral and physical force are alike in being both
preceded and accompanied by in-_tens_-ity—tension—tightness of the cords of
power.

It is this tautness of the bow-string, this knotting of the muscles, this contraction
before the spring, that makes an audience _feel_—almost see—the reserve power
in a speaker. In some really wonderful way it is more what a speaker does _not_
say and do that reveals the dynamo within. _Anything_ may come from such
stored-up force once it is let loose; and that keeps an audience alert, hanging on
the lips of a speaker for his next word. After all, it is all a question of manhood,
for a stuffed doll has neither convictions nor emotional tension. If you are
upholstered with sawdust, keep off the platform, for your own speech will
puncture you.

Growing out of this conviction-tension comes _resolve to make the audience_

_share that conviction-tension_. Purpose is the backbone of force; without it
speech is flabby—it may glitter, but it is the iridescence of the spineless jellyfish.
You must hold fast to your resolve if you would hold fast to your audience.

Finally, all this conviction-tension-purpose is lifeless and useless unless it results
in _propulsion_. You remember how Young in his wonderful "Night Thoughts"
delineates the man who

```
Pushes his prudent purpose to resolve,
Resolves, and re-resolves, and dies the same.
```

Let not your force "die a-borning,"—bring it to full life in its conviction,
emotional tension, resolve, and propulsive power.

_Can Force be Acquired?_

Yes, if the acquirer has any such capacities as we have just outlined. How to
acquire this vital factor is suggested in its very analysis: Live with your subject
until you are convinced of its importance.

If your message does not of itself arouse you to tension, _PULL_ yourself together.
When a man faces the necessity of leaping across a crevasse he does not wait for
inspiration, he _wills_ his muscles into tensity for the spring—it is not without
purpose that our English language uses the same word to depict a mighty though
delicate steel contrivance and a quick leap through the air. Then resolve—and let
it all end in actual _punch_.

This truth is worth reiteration: The man within is the final factor. He must supply
the fuel. The audience, or even the man himself, may add the match—it matters
little which, only so that there be fire. However skillfully your engine is
constructed, however well it works, you will have no force if the fire has gone
out under the boiler. It matters little how well you have mastered poise, pause,
modulation, and tempo, if your speech lacks fire it is dead. Neither a dead engine
nor a dead speech will move anybody.

Four factors of force are measurably within your control, and in that far may be
acquired: _ideas_, _feeling about the subject_, _wording_, and _delivery_. Each of these is
more or less fully discussed in this volume, except wording, which really
requires a fuller rhetorical study than can here be ventured. It is, however, of the
utmost importance that you should be aware of precisely how wording bears
upon force in a sentence. Study "The Working Principles of Rhetoric," by John

Franklin Genung, or the rhetorical treatises of Adams Sherman Hill, of Charles
Sears Baldwin, or any others whose names may easily be learned from any
teacher.

Here are a few suggestions on the use of words to attain force:

_Choice of Words_

PLAIN words are more forceful than words less commonly used—_juggle_
has more vigor than _prestidigitate_.

SHORT words are stronger than long words—_end_ has more directness than
_terminate_.

SAXON words are usually more forceful than Latinistic words—for force,
use _wars against_ rather than _militate against_.

SPECIFIC words are stronger than general words—_pressman_ is more
definite than _printer_.

CONNOTATIVE words, those that suggest more than they say, have more
power than ordinary words—"She _let_ herself be married" expresses more
than "She _married_."

EPITHETS, figuratively descriptive words, are more effective than direct
names—"Go tell that _old fox_," has more "punch" than "Go tell that
_sly fellow_." ONOMATOPOETIC words, words that convey the sense by the
sound, are more powerful than other words—_crash_ is more effective
than _cataclysm_.

_Arrangement of words_

Cut out modifiers.

Cut out connectives.

Begin with words that demand attention.

"End with words that deserve distinction," says Prof. Barrett Wendell.

Set strong ideas over against weaker ones, so as to gain strength by the
contrast.

Avoid elaborate sentence structure—short sentences are stronger than
long ones.

Cut out every useless word, so as to give prominence to the really
important ones.

Let each sentence be a condensed battering ram, swinging to its final
blow on the attention.

A familiar, homely idiom, if not worn by much use, is more effective
than a highly formal, scholarly expression.

Consider well the relative value of different positions in the sentence
so that you may give the prominent place to ideas you wish to emphasize.

"But," says someone, "is it not more honest to depend the inherent interest in a
subject, its native truth, clearness and sincerity of presentation, and beauty of
utterance, to win your audience? Why not charm men instead of capturing them
by assault?"

_Why Use Force?_

There is much truth in such an appeal, but not all the truth. Clearness,
persuasion, beauty, simple statement of truth, are all essential—indeed, they are
all definite parts of a forceful presentment of a subject, without being the only
parts. Strong meat may not be as attractive as ices, but all depends on the
appetite and the stage of the meal.

You can not deliver an aggressive message with caressing little strokes. No! Jab
it in with hard, swift solar plexus punches. You cannot strike fire from flint or
from an audience with love taps. Say to a crowded theatre in a lackadaisical
manner: "It seems to me that the house is on fire," and your announcement may
be greeted with a laugh. If you flash out the words: "The house's on fire!" they
will crush one another in getting to the exits.

The spirit and the language of force are definite with conviction. No immortal
speech in literature contains such expressions as "it seems to me," "I should
judge," "in my opinion," "I suppose," "perhaps it is true." The speeches that will
live have been delivered by men ablaze with the courage of their convictions,
who uttered their words as eternal truth. Of Jesus it was said that "the common
people heard Him gladly." Why? "He taught them as one having _AUTHORITY_."
An audience will never be moved by what "seems" to you to be truth or what in
your "humble opinion" may be so. If you honestly can, assert convictions as your
conclusions. Be sure you are right before you speak your speech, then utter your
thoughts as though they were a Gibraltar of unimpeachable _truth_. Deliver them
with the iron hand and confidence of a Cromwell. Assert them with the fire of
_authority_. Pronounce them as an _ultimatum_. If you cannot speak with conviction,
be silent.

What force did that young minister have who, fearing to be too dogmatic, thus
exhorted his hearers: "My friends—as I assume that you are—it appears to be
my duty to tell you that if you do not repent, so to speak, forsake your sins, as it
were, and turn to righteousness, if I may so express it, you will be lost, in a
measure"?

Effective speech must reflect the era. This is not a rose water age, and a tepid,
half-hearted speech will not win. This is the century of trip hammers, of
overland expresses that dash under cities and through mountain tunnels, and you
must instill this spirit into your speech if you would move a popular audience.
From a front seat listen to a first-class company present a modern Broadway
drama—not a comedy, but a gripping, thrilling drama. Do not become absorbed
in the story; reserve all your attention for the technique and the force of the
acting. There is a kick and a crash as well as an infinitely subtle intensity in the
big, climax-speeches that suggest this lesson: the same well-calculated,
restrained, delicately shaded force would simply _rivet_ your ideas in the minds of
your audience. An air-gun will rattle bird-shot against a window pane—it takes a
rifle to wing a bullet through plate glass and the oaken walls beyond.

_When to Use Force_

An audience is unlike the kingdom of heaven—the violent do not always take it
by force. There are times when beauty and serenity should be the only bells in
your chime. Force is only one of the great extremes of contrast—use neither it
nor quiet utterance to the exclusion of other tones: be various, and in variety find
even greater force than you could attain by attempting its constant use. If you are

reading an essay on the beauties of the dawn, talking about the dainty bloom of a
honey-suckle, or explaining the mechanism of a gas engine, a vigorous style of
delivery is entirely out of place. But when you are appealing to wills and
consciences for immediate action, forceful delivery wins. In such cases, consider
the minds of your audience as so many safes that have been locked and the keys
lost. Do not try to figure out the combinations. Pour a little nitro glycerine into
the cracks and light the fuse. As these lines are being written a contractor down
the street is clearing away the rocks with dynamite to lay the foundations for a
great building. When you want to get action, do not fear to use dynamite.

The final argument for the effectiveness of force in public speech is the fact that
everything must be enlarged for the purposes of the platform—that is why so
few speeches read well in the reports on the morning after: statements appear
crude and exaggerated because they are unaccompanied by the forceful delivery
of a glowing speaker before an audience heated to attentive enthusiasm. So in
preparing your speech you must not err on the side of mild statement—your
audience will inevitably tone down your words in the cold grey of afterthought.
When Phidias was criticised for the rough, bold outlines of a figure he had
submitted in competition, he smiled and asked that his statue and the one
wrought by his rival should be set upon the column for which the sculpture was
destined. When this was done all the exaggerations and crudities, toned by
distances, melted into exquisite grace of line and form. Each speech must be a
special study in suitability and proportion.

Omit the thunder of delivery, if you will, but like Wendell Phillips put "silent
lightning" into your speech. Make your thoughts breathe and your words burn.
Birrell said: "Emerson writes like an electrical cat emitting sparks and shocks in
every sentence." Go thou and speak likewise. Get the "big stick" into your
delivery—be forceful.

My advice to workingmen is this:

If you want power in this country; if you want to make yourselves
felt; if you do not want your children to wait long years before they
have the bread on the table they ought to have, the leisure in their
lives they ought to have, the opportunities in life they ought to have;
if you don't want to wait yourselves,—write on your banner, so that
every political trimmer can read it, so that every politician, no matter
how short-sighted he may be, can read it, "_WE NEVER FORGET!_ If
you launch the arrow of sarcasm at labor, _WE NEVER FORGET!_ If
there is a division in Congress, and you throw your vote in the
wrong scale, _WE NEVER FORGET!_ You may go down on your
knees, and say, 'I am sorry I did the act'—but we will say '_IT WILL_
_AVAIL YOU IN HEAVEN TO BE SORRY, BUT ON THIS SIDE OF_
_THE GRAVE, NEVER!_'" So that a man in taking up the labor
question will know he is dealing with a hair-trigger pistol, and will
say, "I am to be true to justice and to man; otherwise I am a dead
duck."

In Russia there is no press, no debate, no explanation of what
government does, no remonstrance allowed, no agitation of public
issues. Dead silence, like that which reigns at the summit of Mont
Blanc, freezes the whole empire, long ago described as "a despotism
tempered by assassination." Meanwhile, such despotism has
unsettled the brains of the ruling family, as unbridled power
doubtless made some of the twelve Cæsars insane; a madman,
sporting with the lives and comfort of a hundred millions of men.
The young girl whispers in her mother's ear, under a ceiled roof, her
pity for a brother knouted and dragged half dead into exile for his
opinions. The next week she is stripped naked and flogged to death
in the public square. No inquiry, no explanation, no trial, no protest,
one dead uniform silence, the law of the tyrant. Where is there
ground for any hope of peaceful change? No, no! in such a land
dynamite and the dagger are the necessary and proper substitutes for
Faneuil Hall. Anything that will make the madman quake in his
bedchamber, and rouse his victims into reckless and desperate

FEELING AND ENTHUSIASM
```

```
Enthusiasm is that secret and harmonious spirit that hovers over the
production of genius.
```

```
—ISAAC DISRAELI, Literary Character.
```

If you are addressing a body of scientists on such a subject as the veins in a
butterfly's wings, or on road structure, naturally your theme will not arouse much
feeling in either you or your audience. These are purely mental subjects. But if
you want men to vote for a measure that will abolish child labor, or if you would
inspire them to take up arms for freedom, you must strike straight at their
feelings. We lie on soft beds, sit near the radiator on a cold day, eat cherry pie,
and devote our attention to one of the opposite sex, not because we have
reasoned out that it is the right thing to do, but because it feels right. No one but
a dyspeptic chooses his diet from a chart. Our feelings dictate what we shall eat
and generally how we shall act. Man is a feeling animal, hence the public
speaker's ability to arouse men to action depends almost wholly on his ability to
touch their emotions.

Negro mothers on the auction-block seeing their children sold away from them
into slavery have flamed out some of America's most stirring speeches. True, the
mother did not have any knowledge of the technique of speaking, but she had
something greater than all technique, more effective than reason: feeling. The
great speeches of the world have not been delivered on tariff reductions or post-
office appropriations. The speeches that will live have been charged with
emotional force. Prosperity and peace are poor developers of eloquence. When
great wrongs are to be righted, when the public heart is flaming with passion,

that is the occasion for memorable speaking. Patrick Henry made an immortal
address, for in an epochal crisis he pleaded for liberty. He had roused himself to
the point where he could honestly and passionately exclaim, "Give me liberty or
give me death." His fame would have been different had he lived to-day and
argued for the recall of judges.

_The Power of Enthusiasm_

Political parties hire bands, and pay for applause—they argue that, for vote-
getting, to stir up enthusiasm is more effective than reasoning. How far they are
right depends on the hearers, but there can be no doubt about the contagious
nature of enthusiasm. A watch manufacturer in New York tried out two series of
watch advertisements; one argued the superior construction, workmanship,
durability, and guarantee offered with the watch; the other was headed, "A Watch
to be Proud of," and dwelt upon the pleasure and pride of ownership. The latter
series sold twice as many as the former. A salesman for a locomotive works
informed the writer that in selling railroad engines emotional appeal was
stronger than an argument based on mechanical excellence.

Illustrations without number might be cited to show that in all our actions we are
emotional beings. The speaker who would speak efficiently must develop the
power to arouse feeling.

Webster, great debater that he was, knew that the real secret of a speaker's power
was an emotional one. He eloquently says of eloquence:

```
"Affected passion, intense expression, the pomp of declamation, all
may aspire after it; they cannot reach it. It comes, if it come at all,
like the outbreak of a fountain from the earth, or the bursting forth of
volcanic fires, with spontaneous, original, native force.
```

```
"The graces taught in the schools, the costly ornaments and studied
contrivances of speech, shock and disgust men, when their own
lives, and the fate of their wives, their children, and their country
hang on the decision of the hour. Then words have lost their power,
rhetoric is in vain, and all elaborate oratory contemptible. Even
genius itself then feels rebuked and subdued, as in the presence of
higher qualities. Then patriotism is eloquent, then self-devotion is
eloquent. The clear conception outrunning the deductions of logic,
the high purpose, the firm resolve, the dauntless spirit, speaking on
the tongue, beaming from the eye, informing every feature, and
```

```
urging the whole man onward, right onward to his subject—this, this
is eloquence; or rather, it is something greater and higher than all
eloquence; it is action, noble, sublime, godlike action."
```

When traveling through the Northwest some time ago, one of the present writers
strolled up a village street after dinner and noticed a crowd listening to a "faker"
speaking on a corner from a goods-box. Remembering Emerson's advice about
learning something from every man we meet, the observer stopped to listen to
this speaker's appeal. He was selling a hair tonic, which he claimed to have
discovered in Arizona. He removed his hat to show what this remedy had done
for him, washed his face in it to demonstrate that it was as harmless as water, and
enlarged on its merits in such an enthusiastic manner that the half-dollars poured
in on him in a silver flood. When he had supplied the audience with hair tonic,
he asked why a greater proportion of men than women were bald. No one knew.
He explained that it was because women wore thinner-soled shoes, and so made
a good electrical connection with mother earth, while men wore thick, dry-soled
shoes that did not transmit the earth's electricity to the body. Men's hair, not
having a proper amount of electrical food, died and fell out. Of course he had a
remedy—a little copper plate that should be nailed on the bottom of the shoe. He
pictured in enthusiastic and vivid terms the desirability of escaping baldness—
and paid tributes to his copper plates. Strange as it may seem when the story is
told in cold print, the speaker's enthusiasm had swept his audience with him, and
they crushed around his stand with outstretched "quarters" in their anxiety to be
the possessors of these magical plates!

Emerson's suggestion had been well taken—the observer had seen again the
wonderful, persuasive power of enthusiasm!

Enthusiasm sent millions crusading into the Holy Land to redeem it from the
Saracens. Enthusiasm plunged Europe into a thirty years' war over religion.
Enthusiasm sent three small ships plying the unknown sea to the shores of a new
world. When Napoleon's army were worn out and discouraged in their ascent of
the Alps, the Little Corporal stopped them and ordered the bands to play the
Marseillaise. Under its soul-stirring strains there were no Alps.

Listen! Emerson said: "Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm."
Carlyle declared that "Every great movement in the annals of history has been
the triumph of enthusiasm." It is as contagious as measles. Eloquence is half
inspiration. Sweep your audience with you in a pulsation of enthusiasm. Let
yourself go. "A man," said Oliver Cromwell, "never rises so high as when he

knows not whither he is going."

_How are We to Acquire and Develop Enthusiasm?_

It is not to be slipped on like a smoking jacket. A book cannot furnish you with
it. It is a growth—an effect. But an effect of what? Let us see.

Emerson wrote: "A painter told me that nobody could draw a tree without in
some sort becoming a tree; or draw a child by studying the outlines of his form
merely,—but, by watching for a time his motion and plays, the painter enters his
nature, and then can draw him at will in every attitude. So Roos 'entered into the
inmost nature of his sheep.' I knew a draughtsman employed in a public survey,
who found that he could not sketch the rocks until their geological structure was
first explained to him."

When Sarah Bernhardt plays a difficult role she frequently will speak to no one
from four o'clock in the afternoon until after the performance. From the hour of
four she lives her character. Booth, it is reported, would not permit anyone to
speak to him between the acts of his Shakesperean rôles, for he was Macbeth
then—not Booth. Dante, exiled from his beloved Florence, condemned to death,
lived in caves, half starved; then Dante wrote out his heart in "The Divine
Comedy." Bunyan entered into the spirit of his "Pilgrim's Progress" so
thoroughly that he fell down on the floor of Bedford jail and wept for joy.
Turner, who lived in a garret, arose before daybreak and walked over the hills
nine miles to see the sun rise on the ocean, that he might catch the spirit of its
wonderful beauty. Wendell Phillips' sentences were full of "silent lightning"
because he bore in his heart the sorrow of five million slaves.

There is only one way to get feeling into your speaking—and whatever else you
forget, forget not this: _You must actually ENTER INTO_ the character you
impersonate, the cause you advocate, the case you argue—enter into it so deeply
that it clothes you, enthralls you, possesses you wholly. Then you are, in the true
meaning of the word, in _sympathy_ with your subject, for its feeling is your
feeling, you "feel with" it, and therefore your enthusiasm is both genuine and
contagious. The Carpenter who spoke as "never man spake" uttered words born
out of a passion of love for humanity—he had entered into humanity, and thus
became Man.

But we must not look upon the foregoing words as a facile prescription for
decocting a feeling which may then be ladled out to a complacent audience in
quantities to suit the need of the moment. Genuine feeling in a speech is bone

and blood of the speech itself and not something that may be added to it or
substracted at will. In the ideal address theme, speaker and audience become
one, fused by the emotion and thought of the hour.

_The Need of Sympathy for Humanity_

It is impossible to lay too much stress on the necessity for the speaker's having a
broad and deep tenderness for human nature. One of Victor Hugo's biographers
attributes his power as an orator and writer to his wide sympathies and profound
religious feelings. Recently we heard the editor of _Collier's Weekly_ speak on
short-story writing, and he so often emphasized the necessity for this broad love
for humanity, this truly religious feeling, that he apologized twice for delivering
a sermon. Few if any of the immortal speeches were ever delivered for a selfish
or a narrow cause—they were born out of a passionate desire to help humanity;
instances, Paul's address to the Athenians on Mars Hill, Lincoln's Gettysburg
speech, The Sermon on the Mount, Henry's address before the Virginia
Convention of Delegates.

The seal and sign of greatness is a desire to serve others. Self-preservation is the
first law of life, but self-abnegation is the first law of greatness—and of art.
Selfishness is the fundamental cause of all sin, it is the thing that all great
religions, all worthy philosophies, have struck at. Out of a heart of real sympathy
and love come the speeches that move humanity.

Former United States Senator Albert J. Beveridge in an introduction to one of
the volumes of "Modern Eloquence," says: "The profoundest feeling among the
masses, the most influential element in their character, is the religious element. It
is as instinctive and elemental as the law of self-preservation. It informs the
whole intellect and personality of the people. And he who would greatly
influence the people by uttering their unformed thoughts must have this great
and unanalyzable bond of sympathy with them."

When the men of Ulster armed themselves to oppose the passage of the Home
Rule Act, one of the present writers assigned to a hundred men "Home Rule" as
the topic for an address to be prepared by each. Among this group were some
brilliant speakers, several of them experienced lawyers and political
campaigners. Some of their addresses showed a remarkable knowledge and
grasp of the subject; others were clothed in the most attractive phrases. But a
clerk, without a great deal of education and experience, arose and told how he
spent his boyhood days in Ulster, how his mother while holding him on her lap

had pictured to him Ulster's deeds of valor. He spoke of a picture in his uncle's
home that showed the men of Ulster conquering a tyrant and marching on to
victory. His voice quivered, and with a hand pointing upward he declared that if
the men of Ulster went to war they would not go alone—a great God would go
with them.

The speech thrilled and electrified the audience. It thrills yet as we recall it. The
high-sounding phrases, the historical knowledge, the philosophical treatment, of
the other speakers largely failed to arouse any deep interest, while the genuine
conviction and feeling of the modest clerk, speaking on a subject that lay deep in
his heart, not only electrified his audience but won their personal sympathy for
the cause he advocated.

As Webster said, it is of no use to try to pretend to sympathy or feelings. It
cannot be done successfully. "Nature is forever putting a premium on reality."
What is false is soon detected as such. The thoughts and feelings that create and
mould the speech in the study must be born again when the speech is delivered
from the platform. Do not let your words say one thing, and your voice and
attitude another. There is no room here for half-hearted, nonchalant methods of
delivery. Sincerity is the very soul of eloquence. Carlyle was right: "No
Mirabeau, Napoleon, Burns, Cromwell, no man adequate to do anything, but is
first of all in right earnest about it; what I call a sincere man. I should say
sincerity, a great, deep, genuine sincerity, is the first characteristic of all men in
any way heroic. Not the sincerity that calls itself sincere; ah no, that is a very
poor matter indeed; a shallow braggart, conscious sincerity, oftenest self-conceit
mainly. The great man's sincerity is of the kind he cannot speak of—is not
conscious of."

```
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES
```

It is one thing to convince the would-be speaker that he ought to put feeling into
his speeches; often it is quite another thing for him to do it. The average speaker
is afraid to let himself go, and continually suppresses his emotions. When you
put enough feeling into your speeches they will sound overdone to you, unless
you are an experienced speaker. They will sound too strong, if you are not used
to enlarging for platform or stage, for the delineation of the emotions must be
enlarged for public delivery.

[^1]:. Study the following speech, going back in your imagination to the time and
circumstances that brought it forth. Make it not a memorized historical

document, but feel the emotions that gave it birth. The speech is only an effect;
live over in your own heart the causes that produced it and try to deliver it at
white heat. It is not possible for you to put too much real feeling into it, though
of course it would be quite easy to rant and fill it with false emotion. This
speech, according to Thomas Jefferson, started the ball of the Revolution rolling.
Men were then willing to go out and die for liberty.

PATRICK HENRY'S SPEECH
```

```
BEFORE THE VIRGINIA CONVENTION OF DELEGATES
```

```
Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.
We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the
song of that siren, till she transforms us to beasts. Is this the part of
wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are
we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not,
and having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern our
temporal salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may
cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to
provide for it.
```

```
I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided; and that is the
lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by
the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has
been in the conduct of the British Ministry for the last ten years to
justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to
solace themselves and the House? Is it that insidious smile with
which our petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir; it will
prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be "betrayed with
a kiss"! Ask yourselves, how this gracious reception of our petition
comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters
and darken our land. Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of
love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to
be reconciled, that force must be called in to win back our love? Let
us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements of war and
subjugation, the last "arguments" to which kings resort.
```

```
I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be
not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign any other
```

possible motive for it? Has Great Britain any enemy in this quarter
of the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies?
No, sir, she has none. They are meant for us; they can be meant for
no other. They are sent over to bind and to rivet upon us those chains
which the British Ministry have been so long forging. And what
have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we have
been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new to offer
upon the subject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in every
light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we
resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we find
which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you,
sir, deceive ourselves longer. Sir, we have done everything that
could be done, to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have
petitioned, we have remonstrated, we have supplicated, we have
prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its
interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the Ministry and
Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances
have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have
been disregarded, and we have been spurned with contempt from the
foot of the throne. In vain, after these things, may we indulge in the
fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room
for hope. If we wish to be free, if we mean to preserve inviolate
those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long
contending; if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in
which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged
ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest
shall be obtained, we must fight; I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An
appeal to arms, and to the God of Hosts, is all that is left us!

They tell us, sir, that we are weak—"unable to cope with so
formidable an adversary"! But when shall we be stronger? Will it be
the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally
disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every
house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall
we acquire the means of effectual resistance, by lying supinely on
our backs, and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our
enemies have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak, if we
make a proper use of those means which the God of Nature hath
placed in our power. Three millions of people, armed in the holy

```
cause of Liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are
invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us.
Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just
Power who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise
up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the
strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir,
we have no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now
too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat, but in
submission and slavery. Our chains are forged. Their clanking may
be heard on the plains of Boston. The war is inevitable; and let it
come! I repeat it, sir, let it come! It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the
matter. Gentlemen may cry "Peace, peace!" but there is no peace!
The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north
will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are
already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that
gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so
sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid
it, Almighty Powers!—I know not what course others may take; but
as for me, give me liberty or give me death!
```

[^2]:. Live over in your imagination all the solemnity and sorrow that Lincoln felt at
the Gettysburg cemetery. The feeling in this speech is very deep, but it is quieter
and more subdued than the preceding one. The purpose of Henry's address was
to get action; Lincoln's speech was meant only to dedicate the last resting place
of those who had acted. Read it over and over (see page [^5]:[^0]:) until it burns in your
soul. Then commit it and repeat it for emotional expression.

[^3]:. Beecher's speech on Lincoln, page [^7]:[^6]:; Thurston's speech on "A Plea for
Cuba," page [^5]:[^0]:; and the following selection, are recommended for practise in
developing feeling in delivery.

A living force that brings to itself all the resources of imagination,
all the inspirations of feeling, all that is influential in body, in voice,

analogy with the divine thought and the divine arrangement; and
there is no misconstruction more utterly untrue and fatal than this:
that oratory is an artificial thing, which deals with baubles and
trifles, for the sake of making bubbles of pleasure for transient effect
on mercurial audiences. So far from that, it is the consecration of the
whole man to the noblest purposes to which one can address himself

```
FLUENCY THROUGH PREPARATION
```

```
Animis opibusque parati—Ready in mind and resources.
```

```
—Motto of South Carolina.
```

```
In omnibus negotiis prius quam aggrediare, adhibenda est præparatio
diligens—In all matters before beginning a diligent preparation
should be made.
```

```
—CICERO, De Officiis.
```

Take your dictionary and look up the words that contain the Latin stem _flu_—the
results will be suggestive.

At first blush it would seem that fluency consists in a ready, easy use of words.
Not so—the flowing quality of speech is much more, for it is a composite effect,
with each of its prior conditions deserving of careful notice.

_The Sources of Fluency_

Speaking broadly, fluency is almost entirely a matter of preparation. Certainly,
native gifts figure largely here, as in every art, but even natural facility is
dependent on the very same laws of preparation that hold good for the man of
supposedly small native endowment. Let this encourage you if, like Moses, you
are prone to complain that you are not a ready speaker.

Have you ever stopped to analyze that expression, "a ready speaker?" Readiness,
in its prime sense, is preparedness, and they are most ready who are best
prepared. Quick firing depends more on the alert finger than on the hair trigger.
Your fluency will be in direct ratio to two important conditions: your knowledge
of what you are going to say, and your being accustomed to telling what you
know to an audience. This gives us the second great element of fluency—to
preparation must be added the ease that arises from practise; of which more
presently.

_Knowledge is Essential_

Mr. Bryan is a most fluent speaker when he speaks on political problems,
tendencies of the time, and questions of morals. It is to be supposed, however,
that he would not be so fluent in speaking on the bird life of the Florida
Everglades. Mr. John Burroughs might be at his best on this last subject, yet
entirely lost in talking about international law. Do not expect to speak fluently on
a subject that you know little or nothing about. Ctesiphon boasted that he could
speak all day (a sin in itself) on any subject that an audience would suggest. He
was banished by the Spartans.

But preparation goes beyond the getting of the facts in the case you are to
present: it includes also the ability to think and arrange your thoughts, a full and
precise vocabulary, an easy manner of speech and breathing, absence of self-
consciousness, and the several other characteristics of efficient delivery that have
deserved special attention in other parts of this book rather than in this chapter.

Preparation may be either general or specific; usually it should be both. A life-
time of reading, of companionship with stirring thoughts, of wrestling with the
problems of life—this constitutes a general preparation of inestimable worth.
Out of a well-stored mind, and—richer still—a broad experience, and—best of
all—a warmly sympathetic heart, the speaker will have to draw much material
that no _immediate_ study could provide. General preparation consists of all that a
man has put into himself, all that heredity and environment have instilled into
him, and—that other rich source of preparedness for speech—the friendship of
wise companions. When Schiller returned home after a visit with Goethe a friend
remarked: "I am amazed by the progress Schiller can make within a single
fortnight." It was the progressive influence of a new friendship. Proper
friendships form one of the best means for the formation of ideas and ideals, for
they enable one to practise in giving expression to thought. The speaker who
would speak fluently before an audience should learn to speak fluently and
entertainingly with a friend. Clarify your ideas by putting them in words; the
talker gains as much from his conversation as the listener. You sometimes begin
to converse on a subject thinking you have very little to say, but one idea gives
birth to another, and you are surprised to learn that the more you give the more
you have to give. This give-and-take of friendly conversation develops
mentality, and fluency in expression. Longfellow said: "A single conversation
across the table with a wise man is better than ten years' study of books," and
Holmes whimsically yet none the less truthfully declared that half the time he
talked to find out what he thought. But that method must not be applied on the
platform!

After all this enrichment of life by storage, must come the special preparation for
the particular speech. This is of so definite a sort that it warrants separate
chapter-treatment later.

_Practise_

But preparation must also be of another sort than the gathering, organizing, and
shaping of materials—it must include _practise_, which, like mental preparation,
must be both general and special.

Do not feel surprised or discouraged if practise on the principles of delivery
herein laid down seems to retard your fluency. For a time, this will be inevitable.
While you are working for proper inflection, for instance, inflection will be
demanding your first thoughts, and the flow of your speech, for the time being,
will be secondary. This warning, however, is strictly for the closet, for your
practise at home. Do not carry any thoughts of inflection with you to the
platform. There you must _think_ only of your subject. There is an absolute
telepathy between the audience and the speaker. If your thought goes to your
gesture, their thought will too. If your interest goes to the quality of your voice,
they will be regarding that instead of what your voice is uttering.

You have doubtless been adjured to "forget everything but your subject." This
advice says either too much or too little. The truth is that while on the platform
you must not _forget_ a great many things that are not in your subject, but you
must not _think_ of them. Your attention must consciously go only to your
message, but subconsciously you will be attending to the points of technique
which have become more or less _habitual by practise_.

A nice balance between these two kinds of attention is important.

You can no more escape this law than you can live without air: Your platform
gestures, your voice, your inflection, will all be just as good as your _habit_ of
gesture, voice, and inflection makes them—no better. Even the thought of
whether you are speaking fluently or not will have the effect of marring your
flow of speech.

Return to the opening chapter, on self-confidence, and again lay its precepts to
heart. Learn by rules to speak without thinking of rules. It is not—or ought not to
be—necessary for you to stop to think how to say the alphabet correctly, as a
matter of fact it is slightly more difficult for you to repeat Z, Y, X than it is to say
X, Y, Z—habit has established the order. Just so you must master the laws of

efficiency in speaking until it is a second nature for you to speak correctly rather
than otherwise. A beginner at the piano has a great deal of trouble with the
mechanics of playing, but as time goes on his fingers become trained and almost
instinctively wander over the keys correctly. As an inexperienced speaker you
will find a great deal of difficulty at first in putting principles into practise, for
you will be scared, like the young swimmer, and make some crude strokes, but if
you persevere you will "win out."

Thus, to sum up, the vocabulary you have enlarged by study,[[^4]] the ease in
speaking you have developed by practise, the economy of your well-studied
emphasis all will subconsciously come to your aid on the platform. Then the
habits you have formed will be earning you a splendid dividend. The fluency of
your speech will be at the speed of flow your practise has made habitual.

But this means work. What good habit does not? No philosopher's stone that will
act as a substitute for laborious practise has ever been found. If it were, it would
be thrown away, because it would kill our greatest joy—the delight of
acquisition. If public-speaking means to you a fuller life, you will know no
greater happiness than a well-spoken speech. The time you have spent in
gathering ideas and in private practise of speaking you will find amply rewarded.

THE VOICE
```

```
Oh, there is something in that voice that
reaches
The innermost recesses of my spirit!
```

```
—LONGFELLOW, Christus.
```

The dramatic critic of The London _Times_ once declared that acting is nine-tenths
voice work. Leaving the message aside, the same may justly be said of public
speaking. A rich, correctly-used voice is the greatest physical factor of
persuasiveness and power, often over-topping the effects of reason.

But a good voice, well handled, is not only an effective possession for the
professional speaker, it is a mark of personal culture as well, and even a distinct
commercial asset. Gladstone, himself the possessor of a deep, musical voice, has
said: "Ninety men in every hundred in the crowded professions will probably
never rise above mediocrity because the training of the voice is entirely
neglected and considered of no importance." These are words worth pondering.

There are three fundamental requisites for a good voice:

[^1]:_. Ease_

Signor Bonci of the Metropolitan Opera Company says that the secret of good
voice is relaxation; and this is true, for relaxation is the basis of ease. The air
waves that produce voice result in a different kind of tone when striking against
relaxed muscles than when striking constricted muscles. Try this for yourself.
Contract the muscles of your face and throat as you do in hate, and flame out "I
hate you!" Now relax as you do when thinking gentle, tender thoughts, and say,
"I love you." How different the voice sounds.

In practising voice exercises, and in speaking, never force your tones. Ease must
be your watchword. The voice is a delicate instrument, and you must not handle
it with hammer and tongs. Don't _make_ your voice go—_let_ it go. Don't work. Let
the yoke of speech be easy and its burden light.

Your throat should be free from strain during speech, therefore it is necessary to
avoid muscular contraction. The throat must act as a sort of chimney or funnel

for the voice, hence any unnatural constriction will not only harm its tones but
injure its health.

Nervousness and mental strain are common sources of mouth and throat
constriction, so make the battle for poise and self-confidence for which we
pleaded in the opening chapter.

But _how_ can I relax? you ask. By simply _willing_ to relax. Hold your arm out
straight from your shoulder. Now—withdraw all power and let it fall. Practise
relaxation of the muscles of the throat by letting your neck and head fall
forward. Roll the upper part of your body around, with the waist line acting as a
pivot. Let your head fall and roll around as you shift the torso to different
positions. Do not force your head around—simply relax your neck and let
gravity pull it around as your body moves.

Again, let your head fall forward on your breast; raise your head, letting your
jaw hang. Relax until your jaw feels heavy, as though it were a weight hung to
your face. Remember, you must relax the jaw to obtain command of it. It must
be free and flexible for the moulding of tone, and to let the tone pass out
unobstructed.

The lips also must be made flexible, to aid in the moulding of clear and beautiful
tones. For flexibility of lips repeat the syllables, _mo_—_me_. In saying _mo_, bring
the lips up to resemble the shape of the letter O. In repeating _me_ draw them back
as you do in a grin. Repeat this exercise rapidly, giving the lips as much exercise
as possible.

Try the following exercise in the same manner:

Mo—E—O—E—OO—Ah.

After this exercise has been mastered, the following will also be found excellent
for flexibility of lips:

Memorize these _sounds_ indicated (not the _expressions_) so that you can repeat
them rapidly.

```
A as in May. E as in Met. U as in Use.
A " Ah. I " Ice. Oi " Oil.
A " At. I " It. u " Our.
O " No. O " No. O " Ooze.
A " All. OO " Foot. A " Ah.
E " Eat. OO " Ooze. E " Eat.
```

All the activity of breathing must be centered, not in the throat, but in the middle
of the body—you must breathe from the diaphragm. Note the way you breathe
when lying flat on the back, undressed in bed. You will observe that all the
activity then centers around the diaphragm. This is the natural and correct
method of breathing. By constant watchfulness make this your habitual manner,
for it will enable you to relax more perfectly the muscles of the throat.

The next fundamental requisite for good voice is

[^2]:_. Openness_

If the muscles of the throat are constricted, the tone passage partially closed, and
the mouth kept half-shut, how can you expect the tone to come out bright and
clear, or even to come out at all? Sound is a series of waves, and if you make a
prison of your mouth, holding the jaws and lips rigidly, it will be very difficult
for the tone to squeeze through, and even when it does escape it will lack force
and carrying power. Open your mouth wide, relax all the organs of speech, and
let the tone flow out easily.

Start to yawn, but instead of yawning, speak while your throat is open. Make this
open-feeling habitual when speaking—we say _make_ because it is a matter of
resolution and of practise, if your vocal organs are healthy. Your tone passages
may be partly closed by enlarged tonsils, adenoids, or enlarged turbinate bones
of the nose. If so, a skilled physician should be consulted.

The nose is an important tone passage and should be kept open and free for
perfect tones. What we call "talking through the nose" is not talking through the
nose, as you can easily demonstrate by holding your nose as you talk. If you are
bothered with nasal tones caused by growths or swellings in the nasal passages, a
slight, painless operation will remove the obstruction. This is quite important,
aside from voice, for the general health will be much lowered if the lungs are
continually starved for air.

The final fundamental requisite for good voice is

[^3]:_. Forwardness_

A voice that is pitched back in the throat is dark, sombre, and unattractive. The
tone must be pitched forward, but do not _force_ it forward. You will recall that our
first principle was ease. _Think_ the tone forward and out. Believe it is going
forward, and allow it to flow easily. You can tell whether you are placing your
tone forward or not by inhaling a deep breath and singing _ah_ with the mouth
wide open, trying to feel the little delicate sound waves strike the bony arch of
the mouth just above the front teeth. The sensation is so slight that you will
probably not be able to detect it at once, but persevere in your practise, always
thinking the tone forward, and you will be rewarded by feeling your voice strike
the roof of your mouth. A correct forward-placing of the tone will do away with
the dark, throaty tones that are so unpleasant, inefficient, and harmful to the
throat.

Close the lips, humming _ng_, _im_, or _an_. Think the tone forward. Do you feel it
strike the lips?

Hold the palm of your hand in front of your face and say vigorously _crash, dash,_
_whirl, buzz_. Can you feel the forward tones strike against your hand? Practise
until you can. Remember, the only way to get your voice forward is to _put_ it
forward.

_How to Develop the Carrying Power of the Voice_

It is not necessary to speak loudly in order to be heard at a distance. It is
necessary only to speak correctly. Edith Wynne Matthison's voice will carry in a
whisper throughout a large theater. A paper rustling on the stage of a large
auditorium can be heard distinctly in the furthermost seat in the gallery. If you
will only use your voice correctly, you will not have much difficulty in being
heard. Of course it is always well to address your speech to your furthest
auditors; if they get it, those nearer will have no trouble, but aside from this
obvious suggestion, you must observe these laws of voice production:

Remember to apply the principles of ease, openness and forwardness—they are
the prime factors in enabling your voice to be heard at a distance.

Do not gaze at the floor as you talk. This habit not only gives the speaker an
amateurish appearance but if the head is hung forward the voice will be directed

towards the ground instead of floating out over the audience.

Voice is a series of air vibrations. To strengthen it two things are necessary: more
air or breath, and more vibration.

Breath is the very basis of voice. As a bullet with little powder behind it will not
have force and carrying power, so the voice that has little breath behind it will be
weak. Not only will deep breathing—breathing from the diaphragm—give the
voice a better support, but it will give it a stronger resonance by improving the
general health.

Usually, ill health means a weak voice, while abundant physical vitality is shown
through a strong, vibrant voice. Therefore anything that improves the general
vitality is an excellent voice strengthener, provided you _use_ the voice properly.
Authorities differ on most of the rules of hygiene but on one point they all agree:
vitality and longevity are increased by deep breathing. Practise this until it
becomes second nature. Whenever you are speaking, take in deep breaths, but in
such a manner that the inhalations will be silent.

Do not try to speak too long without renewing your breath. Nature cares for this
pretty well unconsciously in conversation, and she will do the same for you in
platform speaking if you do not interfere with her premonitions.

A certain very successful speaker developed voice carrying power by running
across country, practising his speeches as he went. The vigorous exercise forced
him to take deep breaths, and developed lung power. A hard-fought basketball or
tennis game is an efficient way of practising deep breathing. When these
methods are not convenient, we recommend the following:

Place your hands at your sides, on the waist line.

By trying to encompass your waist with your fingers and thumbs, force all the
air out of the lungs.

Take a deep breath. Remember, all the activity is to be centered in the _middle_ of
the body; do not raise the shoulders. As the breath is taken your hands will be
forced out.

Repeat the exercise, placing your hands on the small of the back and forcing
them out as you inhale.

Many methods for deep breathing have been given by various authorities. Get

the air into your lungs—that is the important thing.

The body acts as a sounding board for the voice just as the body of the violin
acts as a sounding board for its tones. You can increase its vibrations by practise.

Place your finger on your lip and hum the musical scale, thinking and placing
the voice forward on the lips. Do you feel the lips vibrate? After a little practise
they will vibrate, giving a tickling sensation.

Repeat this exercise, throwing the humming sound into the nose. Hold the upper
part of the nose between the thumb and forefinger. Can you feel the nose
vibrate?

Placing the palm of your hand on top of your head, repeat this humming
exercise. Think the voice there as you hum in head tones. Can you feel the
vibration there?

Now place the palm of your hand on the back of your head, repeating the
foregoing process. Then try it on the chest. Always remember to think your tone
where you desire to feel the vibrations. The mere act of thinking about any
portion of your body will tend to make it vibrate.

Repeat the following, after a deep inhalation, endeavoring to feel all portions of
your body vibrate at the same time. When you have attained this you will find
that it is a pleasant sensation.

```
What ho, my jovial mates. Come on! We will frolic it like fairies,
frisking in the merry moonshine.
```

_Purity of Voice_

This quality is sometimes destroyed by wasting the breath. Carefully control the
breath, using only as much as is necessary for the production of tone. Utilize all
that you give out. Failure to do this results in a breathy tone. Take in breath like a
prodigal; in speaking, give it out like a miser.

_Voice Suggestions_

Never attempt to force your voice when hoarse.

Do not drink cold water when speaking. The sudden shock to the heated organs
of speech will injure the voice.

Avoid pitching your voice too high—it will make it raspy. This is a common
fault. When you find your voice in too high a range, lower it. Do not wait until
you get to the platform to try this. Practise it in your daily conversation. Repeat
the alphabet, beginning A on the lowest scale possible and going up a note on
each succeeding letter, for the development of range. A wide range will give you
facility in making numerous changes of pitch.

Do not form the habit of listening to your voice when speaking. You will need
your brain to think of what you are saying—reserve your observation for private
practise.

CHAPTER XIII
```

```
VOICE CHARM
```

```
A cheerful temper joined with innocence will make beauty
attractive, knowledge delightful, and wit good-natured.
```

```
—JOSEPH ADDISON, The Tattler.
```

Poe said that "the tone of beauty is sadness," but he was evidently thinking from
cause to effect, not contrariwise, for sadness is rarely a producer of beauty—that
is peculiarly the province of joy.

The exquisite beauty of a sunset is not exhilarating but tends to a sort of
melancholy that is not far from delight The haunting beauty of deep, quiet music
holds more than a tinge of sadness. The lovely minor cadences of bird song at
twilight are almost depressing.

The reason we are affected to sadness by certain forms of placid beauty is
twofold: movement is stimulating and joy-producing, while quietude leads to
reflection, and reflection in turn often brings out the tone of regretful longing for
that which is past; secondly, quiet beauty produces a vague aspiration for the
relatively unattainable, yet does not stimulate to the tremendous effort necessary
to make the dimly desired state or object ours.

We must distinguish, for these reasons, between the sadness of beauty and the
joy of beauty. True, joy is a deep, inner thing and takes in much more than the
idea of bounding, sanguine spirits, for it includes a certain active contentedness
of heart. In this chapter, however the word will have its optimistic, exuberant
connotation—we are thinking now of vivid, bright-eyed, laughing joy.

Musical, joyous tones constitute voice charm, a subtle magnetism that is
delightfully contagious. Now it might seem to the desultory reader that to take
the lancet and cut into this alluring voice quality would be to dissect a butterfly
wing and so destroy its charm. Yet how can we induce an effect if we are not
certain as to the cause?

_Nasal Resonance Produces the Bell-tones of the Voice_

The tone passages of the nose must be kept entirely free for the bright tones of
voice—and after our warning in the preceding chapter you will not confuse what
is popularly and erroneously called a "nasal" tone with the true nasal quality,
which is so well illustrated by the voice work of trained French singers and
speakers.

To develop nasal resonance sing the following, dwelling as long as possible on
the _ng_ sounds. Pitch the voice in the nasal cavity. Practise both in high and low
registers, and develop range—_with brightness_.

```
Sing-song. Ding-dong. Hong-kong. Long-thong.
```

Practise in the falsetto voice develops a bright quality in the normal speaking-
voice. Try the following, and any other selections you choose, in a falsetto voice.
A man's falsetto voice is extremely high and womanish, so men should not
practise in falsetto after the exercise becomes tiresome.

```
She perfectly scorned the best of his clan, and declared the ninth of
any man, a perfectly vulgar fraction.
```

The actress Mary Anderson asked the poet Longfellow what she could do to
improve her voice. He replied, "Read aloud daily, joyous, lyric poetry."

The joyous tones are the bright tones. Develop them by exercise. Practise your
voice exercises in an attitude of joy. Under the influence of pleasure the body
expands, the tone passages open, the action of heart and lungs is accelerated, and
all the primary conditions for good tone are established.

More songs float out from the broken windows of the negro cabins in the South
than from the palatial homes on Fifth Avenue. Henry Ward Beecher said the
happiest days of his life were not when he had become an international character,
but when he was an unknown minister out in Lawrenceville, Ohio, sweeping his
own church, and working as a carpenter to help pay the grocer. Happiness is
largely an attitude of mind, of viewing life from the right angle. The optimistic
attitude can be cultivated, and it will express itself in voice charm. A telephone
company recently placarded this motto in their booths: "The Voice with the
Smile Wins." It does. Try it.

Reading joyous prose, or lyric poetry, will help put smile and joy of soul into
your voice. The following selections are excellent for practise.

_REMEMBER_ that when you first practise these classics you are to give sole
attention to two things: a joyous attitude of heart and body, and bright tones of
voice. After these ends have been attained to your satisfaction, carefully review
the principles of public speaking laid down in the preceding chapters and put
them into practise as you read these passages again and again. _It would be better_
_to commit each selection to memory._

FROM MILTON'S "L'ALLEGRO"
```

Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee
Jest, and youthful Jollity,
Quips and Cranks and wanton Wiles,
Nods and Becks, and wreathèd Smiles,
Such as hang on Hebe's cheek,
And love to live in dimple sleek,—
Sport that wrinkled Care derides,
And Laughter holding both his sides.

Come, and trip it as ye go
On the light fantastic toe;
And in thy right hand lead with thee
The mountain nymph, sweet Liberty:
And, if I give thee honor due,
Mirth, admit me of thy crew,
To live with her, and live with thee,
In unreprovèd pleasures free;

To hear the lark begin his flight,
And singing, startle the dull Night
From his watch-tower in the skies,
Till the dappled Dawn doth rise;
Then to come in spite of sorrow,
And at my window bid good-morrow
Through the sweetbrier, or the vine,
Or the twisted eglantine;
While the cock with lively din
Scatters the rear of darkness thin,
And to the stack, or the barn-door,
Stoutly struts his dames before;

Oft listening how the hounds and horn
Cheerly rouse the slumbering Morn,
From the side of some hoar hill,
Through the high wood echoing shrill;
Sometime walking, not unseen,
By hedge-row elms, on hillocks green,
Right against the eastern gate,
Where the great Sun begins his state,

Robed in flames and amber light,
The clouds in thousand liveries dight,
While the plowman near at hand
Whistles o'er the furrowed land,
And the milkmaid singing blithe,
And the mower whets his scythe,
And every shepherd tells his tale,
Under the hawthorn in the dale.

```
THE SEA
```

The sea, the sea, the open sea,
The blue, the fresh, the fever free;
Without a mark, without a bound,
It runneth the earth's wide regions round;
It plays with the clouds, it mocks the skies,
Or like a cradled creature lies.
I'm on the sea, I'm on the sea,
I am where I would ever be,
With the blue above and the blue below,
And silence wheresoe'er I go.
If a storm should come and awake the deep,
What matter? I shall ride and sleep.

I love, oh! how I love to ride
On the fierce, foaming, bursting tide,
Where every mad wave drowns the moon,
And whistles aloft its tempest tune,
And tells how goeth the world below,
And why the southwest wind doth blow!
I never was on the dull, tame shore

But I loved the great sea more and more,
And backward flew to her billowy breast,
Like a bird that seeketh her mother's nest,—
And a mother she was and is to me,
For I was born on the open sea.

The waves were white, and red the morn,

```
In the noisy hour when I was born;
The whale it whistled, the porpoise rolled,
And the dolphins bared their backs of gold;
And never was heard such an outcry wild,
As welcomed to life the ocean child.
I have lived, since then, in calm and strife,
Full fifty summers a rover's life,
With wealth to spend, and a power to range,
But never have sought or sighed for change:
And death, whenever he comes to me,
Shall come on the wide, unbounded sea!

The sun does not shine for a few trees and flowers, but for the wide
world's joy. The lonely pine upon the mountain-top waves its
sombre boughs, and cries, "Thou art my sun." And the little meadow
violet lifts its cup of blue, and whispers with its perfumed breath,
"Thou art my sun." And the grain in a thousand fields rustles in the
wind, and makes answer, "Thou art my sun." And so God sits
effulgent in Heaven, not for a favored few, but for the universe of
life; and there is no creature so poor or so low that he may not look
up with child-like confidence and say, "My Father! Thou art
mine."—HENRY WARD BEECHER.

Bird of the wilderness,
Blithesome and cumberless,
Sweet be thy matin o'er moorland and lea!
Emblem of happiness,
Blest is thy dwelling-place:
Oh, to abide in the desert with thee!
```

```
Wild is thy lay, and loud,
Far in the downy cloud,—
Love gives it energy; love gave it birth.
Where, on thy dewy wing
Where art thou journeying?
```

```
Thy lay is in heaven; thy love is on earth.
```

```
O'er fell and fountain sheen,
O'er moor and mountain green,
O'er the red streamer that heralds the day;
Over the cloudlet dim,
Over the rainbow's rim,
Musical cherub, soar, singing, away!
```

```
Then, when the gloaming comes,
Low in the heather blooms,
Sweet will thy welcome and bed of love be!
Emblem of happiness,
Blest is thy dwelling-place.
Oh, to abide in the desert with thee!

In joyous conversation there is an elastic touch, a delicate stroke, upon the
central ideas, generally following a pause. This elastic touch adds vivacity to the
voice. If you try repeatedly, it can be sensed by feeling the tongue strike the
teeth. The entire absence of elastic touch in the voice can be observed in the
thick tongue of the intoxicated man. Try to talk with the tongue lying still in the
bottom of the mouth, and you will obtain largely the same effect. Vivacity of
utterance is gained by using the tongue to strike off the emphatic idea with a
decisive, elastic touch.

Deliver the following with decisive strokes on the emphatic ideas. Deliver it in a
vivacious manner, noting the elastic touch-action of the tongue. A flexible,
responsive tongue is absolutely essential to good voice work.

thousand Frenchmen, my companions in glory? They are dead!...
This state of affairs cannot last long; in less than three years it would

THE BROOK
```

```
I come from haunts of coot and hern,
I make a sudden sally,
And sparkle out among the fern,
To bicker down a valley.
```

```
By thirty hills I hurry down,
Or slip between the ridges;
By twenty thorps, a little town,
And half a hundred bridges.
```

```
Till last by Philip's farm I flow
To join the brimming river;
For men may come and men may go,
But I go on forever.
```

```
I chatter over stony ways,
In little sharps and trebles,
```

```
I bubble into eddying bays,
I babble on the pebbles.
```

```
With many a curve my banks I fret,
By many a field and fallow,
And many a fairy foreland set
With willow-weed and mallow.
```

```
I chatter, chatter, as I flow
To join the brimming river;
For men may come and men may go,
But I go on forever.
```

```
I wind about, and in and out,
```

```
With here a blossom sailing,
And here and there a lusty trout,
And here and there a grayling,
```

```
And here and there a foamy flake
Upon me, as I travel,
With many a silvery water-break
Above the golden gravel,
```

```
And draw them all along, and flow
To join the brimming river,
For men may come and men may go,
But I go on forever.
```

```
I steal by lawns and grassy plots,
I slide by hazel covers,
I move the sweet forget-me-nots
That grow for happy lovers.
```

```
I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance,
Among my skimming swallows;
I make the netted sunbeam dance
Against my sandy shallows,
```

```
I murmur under moon and stars
In brambly wildernesses,
I linger by my shingly bars,
I loiter round my cresses;
```

```
And out again I curve and flow
To join the brimming river;
For men may come and men may go,
But I go on forever.
```

The children at play on the street, glad from sheer physical vitality, display a
resonance and charm in their voices quite different from the voices that float
through the silent halls of the hospitals. A skilled physician can tell much about
his patient's condition from the mere sound of the voice. Failing health, or even

physical weariness, tells through the voice. It is always well to rest and be
entirely refreshed before attempting to deliver a public address. As to health,
neither scope nor space permits us to discuss here the laws of hygiene. There are
many excellent books on this subject. In the reign of the Roman emperor
Tiberius, one senator wrote to another: "To the wise, a word is sufficient."

"The apparel oft proclaims the man;" the voice always does—it is one of the
greatest revealers of character. The superficial woman, the brutish man, the
reprobate, the person of culture, often discloses inner nature in the voice, for
even the cleverest dissembler cannot entirely prevent its tones and qualities
being affected by the slightest change of thought or emotion. In anger it becomes
high, harsh, and unpleasant; in love low, soft, and melodious—the variations are
as limitless as they are fascinating to observe. Visit a theatrical hotel in a large
city, and listen to the buzz-saw voices of the chorus girls from some burlesque
"attraction." The explanation is simple—buzz-saw lives. Emerson said: "When a
man lives with God his voice shall be as sweet as the murmur of the brook or the
rustle of the corn." It is impossible to think selfish thoughts and have either an
attractive personality, a lovely character, or a charming voice. If you want to
possess voice charm, cultivate a deep, sincere sympathy for mankind. Love will
shine out through your eyes and proclaim itself in your tones. One secret of the
sweetness of the canary's song may be his freedom from tainted thoughts. Your
character beautifies or mars your voice. As a man thinketh in his heart so is his
voice.

DISTINCTNESS AND PRECISION OF UTTERANCE

In man speaks God.

And endless are the modes of speech, and far

In popular usage the terms "pronunciation," "enunciation," and "articulation" are
synonymous, but real pronunciation includes three distinct processes, and may
therefore be defined as, _the utterance of a syllable or a group of syllables with_
_regard to articulation, accentuation, and enunciation_.

Distinct and precise utterance is one of the most important considerations of
public speech. How preposterous it is to hear a speaker making sounds of
"inarticulate earnestness" under the contented delusion that he is telling
something to his audience! Telling? Telling means communicating, and how can
he actually communicate without making every word distinct?

Slovenly pronunciation results from either physical deformity or habit. A
surgeon or a surgeon dentist may correct a deformity, but your own will,
working by self-observation and resolution in drill, will break a habit. All
depends upon whether you think it worth while.

Defective speech is so widespread that freedom from it is the exception. It is
painfully common to hear public speakers mutilate the king's English. If they do
not actually murder it, as Curran once said, they often knock an _i_ out.

A Canadian clergyman, writing in the _Homiletic Review_, relates that in his
student days "a classmate who was an Englishman supplied a country church for
a Sunday. On the following Monday he conducted a missionary meeting. In the
course of his address he said some farmers thought they were doing their duty
toward missions when they gave their 'hodds and hends' to the work, but the
Lord required more. At the close of the meeting a young woman seriously said
to a friend: 'I am sure the farmers do well if they give their hogs and hens to
missions. It is more than most people can afford.'"

It is insufferable effrontery for any man to appear before an audience who
persists in driving the _h_ out of happiness, home and heaven, and, to paraphrase
Waldo Messaros, will not let it rest in hell. He who does not show enough self-
knowledge to see in himself such glaring faults, nor enough self-mastery to
correct them, has no business to instruct others. If he _can_ do no better, he should
be silent. If he _will_ do no better, he should also be silent.

Barring incurable physical defects—and few are incurable nowadays—the whole
matter is one of will. The catalogue of those who have done the impossible by
faithful work is as inspiring as a roll-call of warriors. "The less there is of you,"
says Nathan Sheppard, "the more need for you to make the most of what there is
of you."

_Articulation_

Articulation is the forming and joining of the elementary sounds of speech. It
seems an appalling task to utter articulately the third-of-a million words that go

to make up our English vocabulary, but the way to make a beginning is really
simple: _learn to utter correctly, and with easy change from one to the other, each_
_of the forty-four elementary sounds in our language_.

The reasons why articulation is so painfully slurred by a great many public
speakers are four: ignorance of the elemental sounds; failure to discriminate
between sounds nearly alike; a slovenly, lazy use of the vocal organs; and a
torpid will. Anyone who is still master of himself will know how to handle each
of these defects.

The vowel sounds are the most vexing source of errors, especially where
diphthongs are found. Who has not heard such errors as are hit off in this
inimitable verse by Oliver Wendell Holmes:

```
Learning condemns beyond the reach of hope
The careless lips that speak of sŏap for sōap;
Her edict exiles from her fair abode
The clownish voice that utters rŏad for rōad;
Less stern to him who calls his cōat, a cŏat
And steers his bōat believing it a bŏat.
She pardoned one, our classic city's boast.
Who said at Cambridge, mŏst instead of mōst,
But knit her brows and stamped her angry foot
To hear a Teacher call a rōōt a rŏŏt.
```

The foregoing examples are all monosyllables, but bad articulation is frequently
the result of joining sounds that do not belong together. For example, no one
finds it difficult to say _beauty_, but many persist in pronouncing _duty_ as though it
were spelled either _dooty_ or _juty_. It is not only from untaught speakers that we
hear such slovenly articulations as _colyum_ for _column_, and _pritty_ for _pretty_, but
even great orators occasionally offend quite as unblushingly as less noted
mortals.

Nearly all such are errors of carelessness, not of pure ignorance—of carelessness
because the ear never tries to hear what the lips articulate. It must be
exasperating to a foreigner to find that the elemental sound _ou_ gives him no hint
for the pronunciation of _bough_, _cough_, _rough_, _thorough_, and _through_, and we
can well forgive even a man of culture who occasionally loses his way amidst
the intricacies of English articulation, but there can be no excuse for the slovenly
utterance of the simple vowel sounds which form at once the life and the beauty

of our language. He who is too lazy to speak distinctly should hold his tongue.

The consonant sounds occasion serious trouble only for those who do not look
with care at the spelling of words about to be pronounced. Nothing but
carelessness can account for saying _Jacop_, _Babtist_, _sevem_, _alwus_, or _sadisfy_.

"He that hath yaws to yaw, let him yaw," is the rendering which an
Anglophobiac clergyman gave of the familiar scripture, "He that hath ears to
hear, let him hear." After hearing the name of Sir Humphry Davy pronounced, a
Frenchman who wished to write to the eminent Englishman thus addressed the
letter: "Serum Fridavi."

_Accentuation_

Accentuation is the stressing of the proper syllables in words. This it is that is
popularly called _pronunciation_. For instance, we properly say that a word is
mispronounced when it is accented _in'-vite_instead of _in-vite'_, though it is really
an offense against only one form of pronunciation—accentuation.

It is the work of a lifetime to learn the accents of a large vocabulary and to keep
pace with changing usage; but an alert ear, the study of word-origins, and the
dictionary habit, will prove to be mighty helpers in a task that can never be
finally completed.

_Enunciation_

Correct enunciation is the complete utterance of all the sounds of a syllable or a
word. Wrong articulation gives the wrong sound to the vowel or vowels of a
word or a syllable, as _doo_ for _dew_; or unites two sounds improperly, as _hully_ for
_wholly_. Wrong enunciation is the _incomplete_ utterance of a syllable or a word,
the sound omitted or added being usually consonantal. To say _needcessity_
instead of _necessity_ is a wrong articulation; to say _doin_ for _doing_ is improper
enunciation. The one articulates—that is, joints—two sounds that should not be
joined, and thus gives the word a positively wrong sound; the other fails to touch
all the sounds in the word, and _in that particular way_ also sounds the word
incorrectly.

"My tex' may be foun' in the fif' and six' verses of the secon' chapter of Titus;

and the subjec' of my discourse is 'The Gover'ment of ar Homes.'"[[^6]]

What did this preacher do with his final consonants? This slovenly dropping of
essential sounds is as offensive as the common habit of running words together

so that they lose their individuality and distinctness. _Lighten dark_, _uppen down_,
_doncher know_, _partic'lar_, _zamination_, are all too common to need comment.

Imperfect enunciation is due to lack of attention and to lazy lips. It can be
corrected by resolutely attending to the formation of syllables as they are uttered.
Flexible lips will enunciate difficult combinations of sounds without slighting
any of them, but such flexibility cannot be attained except by habitually uttering
words with distinctness and accuracy. A daily exercise in enunciating a series of
sounds will in a short time give flexibility to the lips and alertness to the mind,
so that no word will be uttered without receiving its due complement of sound.

Returning to our definition, we see that when the sounds of a word are properly
articulated, the right syllables accented, and full value given to each sound in its
enunciation, we have correct pronunciation. Perhaps one word of caution is
needed here, lest any one, anxious to bring out clearly every sound, should
overdo the matter and neglect the unity and smoothness of pronunciation. Be
careful not to bring syllables into so much prominence as to make words seem
long and angular. The joints must be kept decently dressed.

Before delivery, do not fail to go over your manuscript and note every sound that
may possibly be mispronounced. Consult the dictionary and make assurance
doubly sure. If the arrangement of words is unfavorable to clear enunciation,
change either words or order and do not rest until you can follow Hamlet's
directions to the players.

Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
As "Well, well, we know," or "We could, an if we would,"

THE LAST SPEECH OF MAXIMILIAN DE ROBESPIERRE
```

```
The enemies of the Republic call me tyrant! Were I such they would
grovel at my feet. I should gorge them with gold, I should grant
```

them immunity for their crimes, and they would be grateful. Were I
such, the kings we have vanquished, far from denouncing
Robespierre, would lend me their guilty support; there would be a
covenant between them and me. Tyranny must have tools. But the
enemies of tyranny,—whither does their path tend? To the tomb, and
to immortality! What tyrant is my protector? To what faction do I
belong? Yourselves! What faction, since the beginning of the
Revolution, has crushed and annihilated so many detected traitors?
You, the people,—our principles—are that faction—a faction to
which I am devoted, and against which all the scoundrelism of the
day is banded!

The confirmation of the Republic has been my object; and I know
that the Republic can be established only on the eternal basis of
morality. Against me, and against those who hold kindred principles,
the league is formed. My life? Oh! my life I abandon without a
regret! I have seen the past; and I foresee the future. What friend of
this country would wish to survive the moment when he could no
longer serve it,—when he could no longer defend innocence against
oppression? Wherefore should I continue in an order of things,
where intrigue eternally triumphs over truth; where justice is
mocked; where passions the most abject, or fears the most absurd,
over-ride the sacred interests of humanity? In witnessing the
multitude of vices which the torrent of the Revolution has rolled in
turbid communion with its civic virtues, I confess that I have
sometimes feared that I should be sullied, in the eyes of posterity, by
the impure neighborhood of unprincipled men, who had thrust
themselves into association with the sincere friends of humanity; and
I rejoice that these conspirators against my country have now, by
their reckless rage, traced deep the line of demarcation between
themselves and all true men.

Question history, and learn how all the defenders of liberty, in all
times, have been overwhelmed by calumny. But their traducers died
also. The good and the bad disappear alike from the earth; but in
very different conditions. O Frenchmen! O my countrymen! Let not
your enemies, with their desolating doctrines, degrade your souls,
and enervate your virtues! No, Chaumette, no! Death is not "an
eternal sleep!" Citizens! efface from the tomb that motto, graven by

```
sacrilegious hands, which spreads over all nature a funereal crape,
takes from oppressed innocence its support, and affronts the
beneficent dispensation of death! Inscribe rather thereon these
words: "Death is the commencement of immortality!" I leave to the
oppressors of the People a terrible testament, which I proclaim with
the independence befitting one whose career is so nearly ended; it is
the awful truth—"Thou shalt die!"

THE TRUTH ABOUT GESTURE
```

```
When Whitefield acted an old blind man advancing by slow steps
toward the edge of the precipice, Lord Chesterfield started up and
cried: "Good God, he is gone!"—NATHAN SHEPPARD, Before an
Audience.
```

Gesture is really a simple matter that requires observation and common sense
rather than a book of rules. Gesture is an outward expression of an inward
condition. It is merely an effect—the effect of a mental or an emotional impulse
struggling for expression through physical avenues.

You must not, however, begin at the wrong end: if you are troubled by your
gestures, or a lack of gestures, attend to the cause, not the effect. It will not in the
least help matters to tack on to your delivery a few mechanical movements. If
the tree in your front yard is not growing to suit you, fertilize and water the soil
and let the tree have sunshine. Obviously it will not help your tree to nail on a
few branches. If your cistern is dry, wait until it rains; or bore a well. Why
plunge a pump into a dry hole?

The speaker whose thoughts and emotions are welling within him like a
mountain spring will not have much trouble to make gestures; it will be merely a
question of properly directing them. If his enthusiasm for his subject is not such
as to give him a natural impulse for dramatic action, it will avail nothing to
furnish him with a long list of rules. He may tack on some movements, but they
will look like the wilted branches nailed to a tree to simulate life. Gestures must
be born, not built. A wooden horse may amuse the children, but it takes a live
one to go somewhere.

It is not only impossible to lay down definite rules on this subject, but it would
be silly to try, for everything depends on the speech, the occasion, the
personality and feelings of the speaker, and the attitude of the audience. It is easy
enough to forecast the result of multiplying seven by six, but it is impossible to
tell any man what kind of gestures he will be impelled to use when he wishes to
show his earnestness. We may tell him that many speakers close the hand, with
the exception of the forefinger, and pointing that finger straight at the audience
pour out their thoughts like a volley; or that others stamp one foot for emphasis;
or that Mr. Bryan often slaps his hands together for great force, holding one palm
upward in an easy manner; or that Gladstone would sometimes make a rush at
the clerk's table in Parliament and smite it with his hand so forcefully that
D'israeli once brought down the house by grimly congratulating himself that
such a barrier stood between himself and "the honorable gentleman."

All these things, and a bookful more, may we tell the speaker, but we cannot
know whether he can use these gestures or not, any more than we can decide
whether he could wear Mr. Bryan's clothes. The best that can be done on this
subject is to offer a few practical suggestions, and let personal good taste decide
as to where effective dramatic action ends and extravagant motion begins.

_Any Gesture That Merely Calls Attention to Itself Is Bad_

The purpose of a gesture is to carry your thought and feeling into the minds and
hearts of your hearers; this it does by emphasizing your message, by interpreting
it, by expressing it in action, by striking its tone in either a physically
descriptive, a suggestive, or a typical gesture—and let it be remembered all the
time that gesture includes _all_ physical movement, from facial expression and the
tossing of the head to the expressive movements of hand and foot. A shifting of
the pose may be a most effective gesture.

What is true of gesture is true of all life. If the people on the street turn around

and watch your walk, your walk is more important than you are—change it. If
the attention of your audience is called to your gestures, they are not convincing,
because they _appear_ to be—what they have a doubtful right to be in reality—
studied. Have you ever seen a speaker use such grotesque gesticulations that you
were fascinated by their frenzy of oddity, but could not follow his thought? Do
not smother ideas with gymnastics. Savonarola would rush down from the high
pulpit among the congregation in the _duomo_ at Florence and carry the fire of
conviction to his hearers; Billy Sunday slides to base on the platform carpet in
dramatizing one of his baseball illustrations. Yet in both instances the message
has somehow stood out bigger than the gesture—it is chiefly in calm
afterthought that men have remembered the _form_ of dramatic expression. When
Sir Henry Irving made his famous exit as "Shylock" the last thing the audience
saw was his pallid, avaricious hand extended skinny and claw-like against the
background. At the time, every one was overwhelmed by the tremendous typical
quality of this gesture; now, we have time to think of its art, and discuss its
realistic power.

Only when gesture is subordinated to the absorbing importance of the idea—a
spontaneous, living expression of living truth—is it justifiable at all; and when it
is remembered for itself—as a piece of unusual physical energy or as a poem of
grace—it is a dead failure as dramatic expression. There is a place for a unique
style of walking—it is the circus or the cake-walk; there is a place for
surprisingly rhythmical evolutions of arms and legs—it is on the dance floor or
the stage. Don't let your agility and grace put your thoughts out of business.

One of the present writers took his first lessons in gesture from a certain college
president who knew far more about what had happened at the Diet of Worms
than he did about how to express himself in action. His instructions were to start
the movement on a certain word, continue it on a precise curve, and unfold the
fingers at the conclusion, ending with the forefinger—just so. Plenty, and more
than plenty, has been published on this subject, giving just such silly directions.
Gesture is a thing of mentality and feeling—not a matter of geometry.
Remember, whenever a pair of shoes, a method of pronunciation, or a gesture
calls attention to itself, it is bad. When you have made really good gestures in a
good speech your hearers will not go away saying, "What beautiful gestures he
made!" but they will say, "I'll vote for that measure." "He is right—I believe in
that."

_Gestures Should Be Born of the Moment_

The best actors and public speakers rarely know in advance what gestures they
are going to make. They make one gesture on certain words tonight, and none at
all tomorrow night at the same point—their various moods and interpretations
govern their gestures. It is all a matter of impulse and intelligent feeling with
them—don't overlook that word _intelligent_. Nature does not always provide the
same kind of sunsets or snow flakes, and the movements of a good speaker vary
almost as much as the creations of nature.

Now all this is not to say that you must not take some thought for your gestures.
If that were meant, why this chapter? When the sergeant despairingly besought
the recruit in the awkward squad to step out and look at himself, he gave
splendid advice—and worthy of personal application. Particularly while you are
in the learning days of public speaking you must learn to criticise your own
gestures. Recall them—see where they were useless, crude, awkward, what not,
and do better next time. There is a vast deal of difference between being
conscious of self and being self-conscious.

It will require your nice discrimination in order to cultivate spontaneous gestures
and yet give due attention to practise. While you depend upon the moment it is
vital to remember that only a dramatic genius can effectively accomplish such
feats as we have related of Whitefield, Savonarola, and others: and doubtless the
first time they were used they came in a burst of spontaneous feeling, yet
Whitefield declared that not until he had delivered a sermon forty times was its
delivery perfected. What spontaneity initiates let practise complete. Every
effective speaker and every vivid actor has observed, considered and practised
gesture until his dramatic actions are a sub-conscious possession, just like his
ability to pronounce correctly without especially concentrating his thought.
Every able platform man has possessed himself of a dozen ways in which he
might depict in gesture any given emotion; in fact, the means for such expression
are endless—and this is precisely why it is both useless and harmful to make a
chart of gestures and enforce them as the ideals of what may be used to express
this or that feeling. Practise descriptive, suggestive, and typical movements until
they come as naturally as a good articulation; and rarely forecast the gestures
you will use at a given moment: leave something to that moment.

_Avoid Monotony in Gesture_

Roast beef is an excellent dish, but it would be terrible as an exclusive diet. No
matter how effective one gesture is, do not overwork it. Put variety in your
actions. Monotony will destroy all beauty and power. The pump handle makes

one effective gesture, and on hot days that one is very eloquent, but it has its
limitations.

_Any Movement that is not Significant, Weakens_

Do not forget that. Restlessness is not expression. A great many useless
movements will only take the attention of the audience from what you are
saying. A widely-noted man introduced the speaker of the evening one Sunday
lately to a New York audience. The only thing remembered about that
introductory speech is that the speaker played nervously with the covering of the
table as he talked. We naturally watch moving objects. A janitor putting down a
window can take the attention of the hearers from Mr. Roosevelt. By making a
few movements at one side of the stage a chorus girl may draw the interest of the
spectators from a big scene between the "leads." When our forefathers lived in
caves they had to watch moving objects, for movements meant danger. We have
not yet overcome the habit. Advertisers have taken advantage of it—witness the
moving electric light signs in any city. A shrewd speaker will respect this law
and conserve the attention of his audience by eliminating all unnecessary
movements.

_Gesture Should either be Simultaneous with or Precede the Words—not Follow_
_Them_

Lady Macbeth says: "Bear welcome in your eye, your hand, your tongue."
Reverse this order and you get comedy. Say, "There he goes," pointing at him
after you have finished your words, and see if the result is not comical.

_Do Not Make Short, Jerky Movements_

Some speakers seem to be imitating a waiter who has failed to get a tip. Let your
movements be easy, and from the shoulder, as a rule, rather than from the elbow.
But do not go to the other extreme and make too many flowing motions—that
savors of the lackadaisical.

Put a little "punch" and life into your gestures. You can not, however, do this
mechanically. The audience will detect it if you do. They may not know just
what is wrong, but the gesture will have a false appearance to them.

_Facial Expression is Important_

Have you ever stopped in front of a Broadway theater and looked at the
photographs of the cast? Notice the row of chorus girls who are supposed to be

expressing fear. Their attitudes are so mechanical that the attempt is ridiculous.
Notice the picture of the "star" expressing the same emotion: his muscles are
drawn, his eyebrows lifted, he shrinks, and fear shines through his eyes. That
actor _felt_ fear when the photograph was taken. The chorus girls felt that it was
time for a rarebit, and more nearly expressed that emotion than they did fear.
Incidentally, that is one reason why they _stay_ in the chorus.

The movements of the facial muscles may mean a great deal more than the
movements of the hand. The man who sits in a dejected heap with a look of
despair on his face is expressing his thoughts and feelings just as effectively as
the man who is waving his arms and shouting from the back of a dray wagon.
The eye has been called the window of the soul. Through it shines the light of
our thoughts and feelings.

_Do Not Use Too Much Gesture_

As a matter of fact, in the big crises of life we do not go through many actions.
When your closest friend dies you do not throw up your hands and talk about
your grief. You are more likely to sit and brood in dry-eyed silence. The Hudson
River does not make much noise on its way to the sea—it is not half so loud as
the little creek up in Bronx Park that a bullfrog could leap across. The barking
dog never tears your trousers—at least they say he doesn't. Do not fear the man
who waves his arms and shouts his anger, but the man who comes up quietly
with eyes flaming and face burning may knock you down. Fuss is not force.
Observe these principles in nature and practise them in your delivery.

The writer of this chapter once observed an instructor drilling a class in gesture.
They had come to the passage from Henry VIII in which the humbled Cardinal
says: "Farewell, a long farewell to all my greatness." It is one of the pathetic
passages of literature. A man uttering such a sentiment would be crushed, and
the last thing on earth he would do would be to make flamboyant movements.
Yet this class had an elocutionary manual before them that gave an appropriate
gesture for every occasion, from paying the gas bill to death-bed farewells. So
they were instructed to throw their arms out at full length on each side and say:
"Farewell, a long farewell to all my greatness." Such a gesture might possibly be
used in an after-dinner speech at the convention of a telephone company whose
lines extended from the Atlantic to the Pacific, but to think of Wolsey's using
that movement would suggest that his fate was just.

_Posture_

The physical attitude to be taken before the audience really is included in
gesture. Just what that attitude should be depends, not on rules, but on the spirit
of the speech and the occasion. Senator La Follette stood for three hours with his
weight thrown on his forward foot as he leaned out over the footlights, ran his
fingers through his hair, and flamed out a denunciation of the trusts. It was very
effective. But imagine a speaker taking that kind of position to discourse on the
development of road-making machinery. If you have a fiery, aggressive message,
and will let yourself go, nature will naturally pull your weight to your forward
foot. A man in a hot political argument or a street brawl never has to stop to
think upon which foot he should throw his weight. You may sometimes place
your weight on your back foot if you have a restful and calm message—but don't
worry about it: just stand like a man who genuinely feels what he is saying. Do
not stand with your heels close together, like a soldier or a butler. No more
should you stand with them wide apart like a traffic policeman. Use simple good
manners and common sense.

Here a word of caution is needed. We have advised you to allow your gestures
and postures to be spontaneous and not woodenly prepared beforehand, but do
not go to the extreme of ignoring the importance of acquiring mastery of your
physical movements. A muscular hand made flexible by free movement, is far
more likely to be an effective instrument in gesture than a stiff, pudgy bunch of
fingers. If your shoulders are lithe and carried well, while your chest does not
retreat from association with your chin, the chances of using good
extemporaneous gestures are so much the better. Learn to keep the _back_ of your
neck touching your collar, hold your chest high, and keep down your waist
measure.

So attention to strength, poise, flexibility, and grace of body are the foundations
of good gesture, for they are expressions of vitality, and without vitality no
speaker can enter the kingdom of power. When an awkward giant like Abraham
Lincoln rose to the sublimest heights of oratory he did so because of the
greatness of his soul—his very ruggedness of spirit and artless honesty were
properly expressed in his gnarly body. The fire of character, of earnestness, and
of message swept his hearers before him when the tepid words of an insincere
Apollo would have left no effect. But be sure you are a second Lincoln before
you despise the handicap of physical awkwardness.

"Ty" Cobb has confided to the public that when he is in a batting slump he even
stands before a mirror, bat in hand, to observe the "swing" and "follow through"
of his batting form. If you would learn to stand well before an audience, look at

yourself in a mirror—but not too often. Practise walking and standing before the
mirror so as to conquer awkwardness—not to cultivate a pose. Stand on the
platform in the same easy manner that you would use before guests in a drawing-
room. If your position is not graceful, make it so by dancing, gymnasium work,
and _by getting grace and poise in your mind_.

Do not continually hold the same position. Any big change of thought
necessitates a change of position. Be at home. There are no rules—it is all a
matter of taste. While on the platform forget that you have any hands until you
desire to use them—then remember them effectively. Gravity will take care of
them. Of course, if you want to put them behind you, or fold them once in
awhile, it is not going to ruin your speech. Thought and feeling are the big things
in speaking—not the position of a foot or a hand. Simply _put_ your limbs where
you want them to be—you have a will, so do not neglect to use it.

Let us reiterate, do not despise practise. Your gestures and movements may be
spontaneous and still be wrong. No matter how natural they are, it is possible to
improve them.

It is impossible for anyone—even yourself—to criticise your gestures until after
they are made. You can't prune a peach tree until it comes up; therefore speak
much, and observe your own speech. While you are examining yourself, do not
forget to study statuary and paintings to see how the great portrayers of nature
have made their subjects express ideas through action. Notice the gestures of the
best speakers and actors. Observe the physical expression of life everywhere.
The leaves on the tree respond to the slightest breeze. The muscles of your face,
the light of your eyes, should respond to the slightest change of feeling. Emerson
says: "Every man that I meet is my superior in some way. In that I learn of him."
Illiterate Italians make gestures so wonderful and beautiful that Booth or Barrett
might have sat at their feet and been instructed. Open your eyes. Emerson says
again: "We are immersed in beauty, but our eyes have no clear vision." Toss this
book to one side; go out and watch one child plead with another for a bite of
apple; see a street brawl; observe life in action. Do you want to know how to
express victory? Watch the victors' hands go high on election night. Do you want
to plead a cause? Make a composite photograph of all the pleaders in daily life
you constantly see. Beg, borrow, and steal the best you can get, _BUT DON'T_
_GIVE IT OUT AS THEFT_. Assimilate it until it becomes a part of you—then _let_
the expression come out.

CHAPTER XVI

```
METHODS OF DELIVERY
```

```
The crown, the consummation, of the discourse is its delivery.
Toward it all preparation looks, for it the audience waits, by it the
speaker is judged.... All the forces of the orator's life converge in his
oratory. The logical acuteness with which he marshals the facts
around his theme, the rhetorical facility with which he orders his
language, the control to which he has attained in the use of his body
as a single organ of expression, whatever richness of acquisition and
experience are his—these all are now incidents; the fact is the
sending of his message home to his hearers.... The hour of delivery
is the "supreme, inevitable hour" for the orator. It is this fact that
makes lack of adequate preparation such an impertinence. And it is
this that sends such thrills of indescribable joy through the orator's
whole being when he has achieved a success—it is like the mother
forgetting her pangs for the joy of bringing a son into the world.
```

```
—J.B.E., How to Attract and Hold an Audience.
```

There are four fundamental methods of delivering an address; all others are
modifications of one or more of these: reading from manuscript, committing the
written speech and speaking from memory, speaking from notes, and
extemporaneous speech. It is impossible to say which form of delivery is best for
all speakers in all circumstances—in deciding for yourself you should consider
the occasion, the nature of the audience, the character of your subject, and your
own limitations of time and ability. However, it is worth while warning you not
to be lenient in self-exaction. Say to yourself courageously: What others can do,
I can attempt. A bold spirit conquers where others flinch, and a trying task
challenges pluck.

_Reading from Manuscript_

This method really deserves short shrift in a book on public speaking, for, delude
yourself as you may, public reading is not public speaking. Yet there are so many
who grasp this broken reed for support that we must here discuss the "read
speech"—apologetic misnomer as it is.

Certainly there are occasions—among them, the opening of Congress, the

presentation of a sore question before a deliberative body, or a historical
commemoration—when it may seem not alone to the "orator" but to all those
interested that the chief thing is to express certain thoughts in precise language—
in language that _must_ not be either misunderstood or misquoted. At such times
oratory is unhappily elbowed to a back bench, the manuscript is solemnly
withdrawn from the capacious inner pocket of the new frock coat, and everyone
settles himself resignedly, with only a feeble flicker of hope that the so-called
speech may not be as long as it is thick. The words may be golden, but the
hearers' (?) eyes are prone to be leaden, and in about one instance out of a
hundred does the perpetrator really deliver an impressive address. His excuse is
his apology—he is not to be blamed, as a rule, for some one decreed that it
would be dangerous to cut loose from manuscript moorings and take his
audience with him on a really delightful sail.

One great trouble on such "great occasions" is that the essayist—for such he is—
has been chosen not because of his speaking ability but because his grandfather
fought in a certain battle, or his constituents sent him to Congress, or his gifts in
some line of endeavor other than speaking have distinguished him.

As well choose a surgeon from his ability to play golf. To be sure, it always
interests an audience to see a great man; because of his eminence they are likely
to listen to his words with respect, perhaps with interest, even when droned from
a manuscript. But how much more effective such a deliverance would be if the
papers were cast aside!

Nowhere is the read-address so common as in the pulpit—the pulpit, that in
these days least of all can afford to invite a handicap. Doubtless many clergymen
prefer finish to fervor—let them choose: they are rarely men who sway the
masses to acceptance of their message. What they gain in precision and elegance
of language they lose in force.

There are just four motives that can move a man to read his address or sermon:

[^1]:. Laziness is the commonest. Enough said. Even Heaven cannot make a lazy
man efficient.

[^2]:. A memory so defective that he really cannot speak without reading. Alas, he is
not speaking when he is reading, so his dilemma is painful—and not to himself
alone. But no man has a right to assume that his memory is utterly bad until he
has buckled down to memory culture—and failed. A weak memory is oftener an
excuse than a reason.

[^3]:. A genuine lack of time to do more than write the speech. There are such
instances—but they do not occur every week! The disposition of your time
allows more flexibility than you realize. Motive [^3]: too often harnesses up with
Motive [^1]:.

[^4]:. A conviction that the speech is too important to risk forsaking the manuscript.
But, if it is vital that every word should be so precise, the style so polished, and
the thoughts so logical, that the preacher must write the sermon entire, is not the
message important enough to warrant extra effort in perfecting its delivery? It is
an insult to a congregation and disrespectful to Almighty God to put the phrasing
of a message above the message itself. To reach the hearts of the hearers the
sermon must be delivered—it is only half delivered when the speaker cannot
utter it with original fire and force, when he merely repeats words that were
conceived hours or weeks before and hence are like champagne that has lost its
fizz. The reading preacher's eyes are tied down to his manuscript; he cannot give
the audience the benefit of his expression. How long would a play fill a theater if
the actors held their cue-books in hand and read their parts? Imagine Patrick
Henry reading his famous speech; Peter-the-Hermit, manuscript in hand,
exhorting the crusaders; Napoleon, constantly looking at his papers, addressing
the army at the Pyramids; or Jesus reading the Sermon on the Mount! These
speakers were so full of their subjects, their general preparation had been so
richly adequate, that there was no necessity for a manuscript, either to refer to or
to serve as "an outward and visible sign" of their preparedness. No event was
ever so dignified that it required an _artificial_ attempt at speech making. Call an
essay by its right name, but never call it a speech. Perhaps the most dignified of
events is a supplication to the Creator. If you ever listened to the reading of an
original prayer you must have felt its superficiality.

Regardless of what the theories may be about manuscript delivery, the fact
remains that it does not work out with efficiency. _Avoid it whenever at all_
_possible._

_Committing the Written Speech and Speaking from Memory_

This method has certain points in its favor. If you have time and leisure, it is
possible to polish and rewrite your ideas until they are expressed in clear,
concise terms. Pope sometimes spent a whole day in perfecting one couplet.
Gibbon consumed twenty years gathering material for and rewriting the "Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire." Although you cannot devote such painstaking
preparation to a speech, you should take time to eliminate useless words, crowd

whole paragraphs into a sentence and choose proper illustrations. Good
speeches, like plays, are not written; they are rewritten. The National Cash
Register Company follows this plan with their most efficient selling
organization: they require their salesmen to memorize verbatim a selling talk.
They maintain that there is one best way of putting their selling arguments, and
they insist that each salesman use this ideal way rather than employ any
haphazard phrases that may come into his mind at the moment.

The method of writing and committing has been adopted by many noted
speakers; Julius Cæsar, Robert Ingersoll, and, on some occasions, Wendell
Phillips, were distinguished examples. The wonderful effects achieved by
famous actors were, of course, accomplished through the delivery of memorized
lines.

The inexperienced speaker must be warned before attempting this method of
delivery that it is difficult and trying. It requires much skill to make it efficient.
The memorized lines of the young speaker will usually _sound_ like memorized
words, and repel.

If you want to hear an example, listen to a department store demonstrator repeat
her memorized lingo about the newest furniture polish or breakfast food. It
requires training to make a memorized speech sound fresh and spontaneous, and,
unless you have a fine native memory, in each instance the finished product
necessitates much labor. Should you forget a part of your speech or miss a few
words, you are liable to be so confused that, like Mark Twain's guide in Rome,
you will be compelled to repeat your lines from the beginning.

On the other hand, you may be so taken up with trying to recall your written
words that you will not abandon yourself to the spirit of your address, and so fail
to deliver it with that spontaneity which is so vital to forceful delivery.

But do not let these difficulties frighten you. If committing seems best to you,
give it a faithful trial. Do not be deterred by its pitfalls, but by resolute practise
avoid them.

One of the best ways to rise superior to these difficulties is to do as Dr. Wallace
Radcliffe often does: commit without writing the speech, making practically all
the preparation mentally, without putting pen to paper—a laborious but effective
way of cultivating both mind and memory.

You will find it excellent practise, both for memory and delivery, to commit the

specimen speeches found in this volume and declaim them, with all attention to
the principles we have put before you. William Ellery Channing, himself a
distinguished speaker, years ago had this to say of practise in declamation:

"Is there not an amusement, having an affinity with the drama, which might be
usefully introduced among us? I mean, Recitation. A work of genius, recited by a
man of fine taste, enthusiasm, and powers of elocution, is a very pure and high
gratification. Were this art cultivated and encouraged, great numbers, now
insensible to the most beautiful compositions, might be waked up to their
excellence and power."

_Speaking from Notes_

The third, and the most popular method of delivery, is probably also the best one
for the beginner. Speaking from notes is not ideal delivery, but we learn to swim
in shallow water before going out beyond the ropes.

Make a definite plan for your discourse (for a fuller discussion see Chapter
XVIII) and set down the points somewhat in the fashion of a lawyer's brief, or a
preacher's outline. Here is a sample of very simple notes:

ATTENTION

I. INTRODUCTION.

```
Attention indispensable to the performance of any
great work. Anecdote.
```

II. DEFINED AND ILLUSTRATED.

```
1. From common observation.
```

```
2. From the lives of great men {Carlyle, Robert E. Lee.}
```

III. ITS RELATION TO OTHER MENTAL POWERS.

```
1. Reason.
```

```
2. Imagination.
```

```
3. Memory.
```

```
4. Will. Anecdote.
```

IV. ATTENTION MAY BE CULTIVATED.

```
1. Involuntary attention.
```

```
2. Voluntary attention. Examples.
```

V. CONCLUSION.

```
The consequences of inattention and of attention.
```

Few briefs would be so precise as this one, for with experience a speaker learns
to use little tricks to attract his eye—he may underscore a catch-word heavily,
draw a red circle around a pivotal idea, enclose the key-word of an anecdote in a
wavy-lined box, and so on indefinitely. These points are worth remembering, for
nothing so eludes the swift-glancing eye of the speaker as the sameness of
typewriting, or even a regular pen-script. So unintentional a thing as a blot on the
page may help you to remember a big "point" in your brief—perhaps by
association of ideas.

An inexperienced speaker would probably require fuller notes than the specimen
given. Yet that way lies danger, for the complete manuscript is but a short
remove from the copious outline. Use as few notes as possible.

They may be necessary for the time being, but do not fail to look upon them as a
necessary evil; and even when you lay them before you, refer to them only when
compelled to do so. Make your notes as full as you please in preparation, but by
all means condense them for platform use.

_Extemporaneous Speech_

Surely this is the ideal method of delivery. It is far and away the most popular
with the audience, and the favorite method of the most efficient speakers.

"Extemporaneous speech" has sometimes been made to mean unprepared
speech, and indeed it is too often precisely that; but in no such sense do we
recommend it strongly to speakers old and young. On the contrary, to speak well
without notes requires all the preparation which we discussed so fully in the

chapter on "Fluency," while yet relying upon the "inspiration of the hour" for
some of your thoughts and much of your language. You had better remember,
however, that the most effective inspiration of the hour is the inspiration you
yourself bring to it, bottled up in your spirit and ready to infuse itself into the
audience.

If you extemporize you can get much closer to your audience. In a sense, they
appreciate the task you have before you and send out their sympathy.
Extemporize, and you will not have to stop and fumble around amidst your notes
—you can keep your eye afire with your message and hold your audience with
your very glance. You yourself will feel their response as you read the effects of
your warm, spontaneous words, written on their countenances.

Sentences written out in the study are liable to be dead and cold when
resurrected before the audience. When you create as you speak you conserve all
the native fire of your thought. You can enlarge on one point or omit another,
just as the occasion or the mood of the audience may demand. It is not possible
for every speaker to use this, the most difficult of all methods of delivery, and
least of all can it be used successfully without much practise, but it is the ideal
towards which all should strive.

One danger in this method is that you may be led aside from your subject into
by-paths. To avoid this peril, firmly stick to your mental outline. Practise
speaking from a memorized brief until you gain control. Join a debating society
—talk, _talk_, _TALK_, and always extemporize. You may "make a fool of yourself"
once or twice, but is that too great a price to pay for success?

Notes, like crutches, are only a sign of weakness. Remember that the power of
your speech depends to some extent upon the view your audience holds of you.
General Grant's words as president were more powerful than his words as a
Missouri farmer. If you would appear in the light of an authority, be one. Make
notes on your brain instead of on paper.

_Joint Methods of Delivery_

A modification of the second method has been adopted by many great speakers,
particularly lecturers who are compelled to speak on a wide variety of subjects
day after day; such speakers often commit their addresses to memory but keep
their manuscripts in flexible book form before them, turning several pages at a
time. They feel safer for having a sheet-anchor to windward—but it is an anchor,
nevertheless, and hinders rapid, free sailing, though it drag never so lightly.

Other speakers throw out a still lighter anchor by keeping before them a rather
full outline of their written and committed speech.

Others again write and commit a few important parts of the address—the
introduction, the conclusion, some vital argument, some pat illustration—and
depend on the hour for the language of the rest. This method is well adapted to
speaking either with or without notes.

Some speakers read from manuscript the most important parts of their speeches
and utter the rest extemporaneously.

Thus, what we have called "joint methods of delivery" are open to much
personal variation. You must decide for yourself which is best for you, for the
occasion, for your subject, for your audience—for these four factors all have
their individual claims.

Whatever form you choose, do not be so weakly indifferent as to prefer the easy
way—choose the _best_ way, whatever it cost you in time and effort. And of this
be assured: only the practised speaker can hope to gain _both_ conciseness of
argument and conviction in manner, polish of language and power in delivery,
finish of style and fire in utterance.

[^1]:. Which in your judgment is the most suitable of delivery for you? Why?

[^2]:. What objections can you offer to, (_a_) memorizing the entire speech; (_b_)
reading from manuscript; (_c_) using notes; (_d_) speaking from memorized outline
or notes; (_e_e) any of the "joint methods"?

methods?

[^4]:. Can you suggest any combination of methods that you have found
efficacious?

[^5]:. What methods, according to your observation, do most successful speakers
use?

[^6]:. Select some topic from the list on page [^1]:[^2]:[^3]:, narrow the theme so as to make it
specific (see page [^1]:[^2]:[^2]:), and deliver a short address, utilizing the four methods
mentioned, in four different deliveries of the speech.

[^7]:. Select one of the joint methods and apply it to the delivery of the same
address.

[^8]:. Which method do you prefer, and why?

[^9]:. From the list of subjects in the Appendix select a theme and deliver a five-
minute address without notes, but make careful preparation without putting your
thoughts on paper.

NOTE: It is earnestly hoped that instructors will not pass this stage of the work
without requiring of their students much practise in the delivery of original
speeches, in the manner that seems, after some experiment, to be best suited to
the student's gifts. Students who are studying alone should be equally exacting in
demand upon themselves. One point is most important: It is easy to learn to read
a speech, therefore it is much more urgent that the pupil should have much
practise in speaking from notes and speaking without notes. At this stage, pay
more attention to manner than to matter—the succeeding chapters take up the
composition of the address. Be particularly insistent upon _frequent_ and _thorough_
review of the principles of delivery discussed in the preceding chapters.

What would happen if you should overdraw your bank account? As a rule the
check would be protested; but if you were on friendly terms with the bank, your
check might be honored, and you would be called upon to make good the
overdraft.

Nature has no such favorites, therefore extends no credits. She is as relentless as
a gasoline tank—when the "gas" is all used the machine stops. It is as reckless
for a speaker to risk going before an audience without having something in
reserve as it is for the motorist to essay a long journey in the wilds without
enough gasoline in sight.

But in what does a speaker's reserve power consist? In a well-founded reliance
on his general and particular grasp of his subject; in the quality of being alert and
resourceful in thought—particularly in the ability to think while on his feet; and
in that self-possession which makes one the captain of all his own forces, bodily
and mental.

The first of these elements, adequate preparation, and the last, self-reliance, were
discussed fully in the chapters on "Self-Confidence" and "Fluency," so they will
be touched only incidentally here; besides, the next chapter will take up specific
methods of preparation for public speaking. Therefore the central theme of this
chapter is the second of the elements of reserve power—Thought.

_The Mental Storehouse_

An empty mind, like an empty larder, may be a serious matter or not—all will
depend on the available resources. If there is no food in the cupboard the
housewife does not nervously rattle the empty dishes; she telephones the grocer.
If you have no ideas, do not rattle your empty _ers_ and _ahs_, but _get_ some ideas,
and don't speak until you do get them.

This, however, is not being what the old New England housekeeper used to call

"forehanded." The real solution of the problem of what to do with an empty head
is never to let it become empty. In the artesian wells of Dakota the water rushes
to the surface and leaps a score of feet above the ground. The secret of this
exuberant flow is of course the great supply below, crowding to get out.

What is the use of stopping to prime a mental pump when you can fill your life
with the resources for an artesian well? It is not enough to have merely enough;
you must have more than enough. Then the pressure of your mass of thought and
feeling will maintain your flow of speech and give you the confidence and poise
that denote reserve power. To be away from home with only the exact return fare
leaves a great deal to circumstances!

Reserve power is magnetic. It does not consist in giving the idea that you are
holding something in reserve, but rather in the suggestion that the audience is
getting the cream of your observation, reading, experience, feeling, thought. To
have reserve power, therefore, you must have enough milk of material on hand
to supply sufficient cream.

But how shall we get the milk? There are two ways: the one is first-hand—from
the cow; the other is second-hand—from the milkman.

_The Seeing Eye_

Some sage has said: "For a thousand men who can speak, there is only one who
can think; for a thousand men who can think, there is only one who can see." To
see and to think is to get your milk from your own cow.

When the one man in a million who can see comes along, we call him Master.
Old Mr. Holbrook, of "Cranford," asked his guest what color ash-buds were in
March; she confessed she did not know, to which the old gentleman answered: "I
knew you didn't. No more did I—an old fool that I am!—till this young man
comes and tells me. 'Black as ash-buds in March.' And I've lived all my life in
the country. More shame for me not to know. Black; they are jet-black, madam."

"This young man" referred to by Mr. Holbrook was Tennyson.

Henry Ward Beecher said: "I do not believe that I have ever met a man on the
street that I did not get from him some element for a sermon. I never see
anything in nature which does not work towards that for which I give the
strength of my life. The material for my sermons is all the time following me and
swarming up around me."

Instead of saying only one man in a million can see, it would strike nearer the
truth to say that none of us sees with perfect understanding more than a fraction
of what passes before our eyes, yet this faculty of acute and accurate observation
is so important that no man ambitious to lead can neglect it. The next time you
are in a car, look at those who sit opposite you and see what you can discover of
their habits, occupations, ideals, nationalities, environments, education, and so
on. You may not see a great deal the first time, but practise will reveal
astonishing results. Transmute every incident of your day into a subject for a
speech or an illustration. Translate all that you see into terms of speech. When
you can describe all that you have seen in definite words, you are seeing clearly.
You are becoming the millionth man.

De Maupassant's description of an author should also fit the public-speaker: "His
eye is like a suction pump, absorbing everything; like a pickpocket's hand,
always at work. Nothing escapes him. He is constantly collecting material,
gathering-up glances, gestures, intentions, everything that goes on in his
presence—the slightest look, the least act, the merest trifle." De Maupassant was
himself a millionth man, a Master.

"Ruskin took a common rock-crystal and saw hidden within its stolid heart
lessons which have not yet ceased to move men's lives. Beecher stood for hours
before the window of a jewelry store thinking out analogies between jewels and
the souls of men. Gough saw in a single drop of water enough truth wherewith to
quench the thirst of five thousand souls. Thoreau sat so still in the shadowy
woods that birds and insects came and opened up their secret lives to his eye.
Emerson observed the soul of a man so long that at length he could say, 'I cannot
hear what you say, for seeing what you are.' Preyer for three years studied the
life of his babe and so became an authority upon the child mind. Observation!
Most men are blind. There are a thousand times as many hidden truths and
undiscovered facts about us to-day as have made discoverers famous—facts
waiting for some one to 'pluck out the heart of their mystery.' But so long as men
go about the search with eyes that see not, so long will these hidden pearls lie in
their shells. Not an orator but who could more effectively point and feather his
shafts were he to search nature rather than libraries. Too few can see 'sermons in
stones' and 'books in the running brooks,' because they are so used to seeing
merely sermons in books and only stones in running brooks. Sir Philip Sidney
had a saying, 'Look in thy heart and write;' Massillon explained his astute
knowledge of the human heart by saying, 'I learned it by studying myself;' Byron
says of John Locke that 'all his knowledge of the human understanding was

derived from studying his own mind.' Since multiform nature is all about us,

originality ought not to be so rare."[[^8]]

_The Thinking Mind_

Thinking is doing mental arithmetic with facts. Add this fact to that and you
reach a certain conclusion. Subtract this truth from another and you have a
definite result. Multiply this fact by another and have a precise product. See how
many times this occurrence happens in that space of time and you have reached a
calculable dividend. In thought-processes you perform every known problem of
arithmetic and algebra. That is why mathematics are such excellent mental
gymnastics. But by the same token, thinking is work. Thinking takes energy.
Thinking requires time, and patience, and broad information, and
clearheadedness. Beyond a miserable little surface-scratching, few people really
think at all—only one in a thousand, according to the pundit already quoted. So
long as the present system of education prevails and children are taught through
the ear rather than through the eye, so long as they are expected to remember
thoughts of others rather than think for themselves, this proportion will continue
—one man in a million will be able to see, and one in a thousand to think.

But, however thought-less a mind has been, there is promise of better things so
soon as the mind detects its own lack of thought-power. The first step is to stop
regarding thought as "the magic of the mind," to use Byron's expression, and see
it as thought truly is—_a weighing of ideas and a placing of them in relationships_
_to each other_. Ponder this definition and see if you have learned to think
efficiently.

Habitual thinking is just that—a habit. Habit comes of doing a thing repeatedly.
The lower habits are acquired easily, the higher ones require deeper grooves if
they are to persist. So we find that the thought-habit comes only with resolute
practise; yet no effort will yield richer dividends. Persist in practise, and whereas
you have been able to think only an inch-deep into a subject, you will soon find
that you can penetrate it a foot.

Perhaps this homely metaphor will suggest how to begin the practise of
consecutive thinking, by which we mean _welding a number of separate thought-_
_links into a chain that will hold_. Take one link at a time, see that each naturally
belongs with the ones you link to it, and remember that a single missing link
means _no chain_.

Thinking is the most fascinating and exhilarating of all mental exercises. Once

realize that your opinion on a subject does not represent the choice you have
made between what Dr. Cerebrum has written and Professor Cerebellum has
said, but is the result of your own earnestly-applied brain-energy, and you will
gain a confidence in your ability to speak on that subject that nothing will be
able to shake. Your thought will have given you both power and reserve power.

Someone has condensed the relation of thought to knowledge in these pungent,
homely lines:

```
"Don't give me the man who thinks he thinks,
Don't give me the man who thinks he knows,
But give me the man who knows he thinks,
And I have the man who knows he knows!"
```

_Reading As a Stimulus to Thought_

No matter how dry the cow, however, nor how poor our ability to milk, there is
still the milkman—we can read what others have seen and felt and thought.
Often, indeed, such records will kindle within us that pre-essential and vital
spark, the _desire_ to be a thinker.

The following selection is taken from one of Dr. Newell Dwight Hillis's lectures,
as given in "A Man's Value to Society." Dr. Hillis is a most fluent speaker—he
never refers to notes. He has reserve power. His mind is a veritable treasure-
house of facts and ideas. See how he draws from a knowledge of fifteen different
general or special subjects: geology, plant life, Palestine, chemistry, Eskimos,
mythology, literature, The Nile, history, law, wit, evolution, religion, biography,
and electricity. Surely, it needs no sage to discover that the secret of this man's
reserve power is the old secret of our artesian well whose abundance surges from
unseen depths.

```
THE USES OF BOOKS AND READING[[^9]]
```

```
Each Kingsley approaches a stone as a jeweler approaches a casket
to unlock the hidden gems. Geikie causes the bit of hard coal to
unroll the juicy bud, the thick odorous leaves, the pungent boughs,
until the bit of carbon enlarges into the beauty of a tropic forest.
That little book of Grant Allen's called "How Plants Grow" exhibits
trees and shrubs as eating, drinking and marrying. We see certain
date groves in Palestine, and other date groves in the desert a
hundred miles away, and the pollen of the one carried upon the trade
```

winds to the branches of the other. We see the tree with its strange
system of water-works, pumping the sap up through pipes and
mains; we see the chemical laboratory in the branches mixing flavor
for the orange in one bough, mixing the juices of the pineapple in
another; we behold the tree as a mother making each infant acorn
ready against the long winter, rolling it in swaths soft and warm as
wool blankets, wrapping it around with garments impervious to the
rain, and finally slipping the infant acorn into a sleeping bag, like
those the Eskimos gave Dr. Kane.

At length we come to feel that the Greeks were not far wrong in
thinking each tree had a dryad in it, animating it, protecting it
against destruction, dying when the tree withered. Some Faraday
shows us that each drop of water is a sheath for electric forces
sufficient to charge [^8]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: Leyden jars, or drive an engine from
Liverpool to London. Some Sir William Thomson tells us how
hydrogen gas will chew up a large iron spike as a child's molars will
chew off the end of a stick of candy. Thus each new book opens up
some new and hitherto unexplored realm of nature. Thus books
fulfill for us the legend of the wondrous glass that showed its owner
all things distant and all things hidden. Through books our world
becomes as "a bud from the bower of God's beauty; the sun as a
spark from the light of His wisdom; the sky as a bubble on the sea of
His Power." Therefore Mrs. Browning's words, "No child can be
called fatherless who has God and his mother; no youth can be
called friendless who has God and the companionship of good
books."

Books also advantage us in that they exhibit the unity of progress,
the solidarity of the race, and the continuity of history. Authors lead
us back along the pathway of law, of liberty or religion, and set us
down in front of the great man in whose brain the principle had its
rise. As the discoverer leads us from the mouth of the Nile back to
the headwaters of Nyanza, so books exhibit great ideas and
institutions, as they move forward, ever widening and deepening,
like some Nile feeding many civilizations. For all the reforms of to-
day go back to some reform of yesterday. Man's art goes back to
Athens and Thebes. Man's laws go back to Blackstone and Justinian.
Man's reapers and plows go back to the savage scratching the

```
ground with his forked stick, drawn by the wild bullock. The heroes
of liberty march forward in a solid column. Lincoln grasps the hand
of Washington. Washington received his weapons at the hands of
Hampden and Cromwell. The great Puritans lock hands with Luther
and Savonarola.
```

```
The unbroken procession brings us at length to Him whose Sermon
on the Mount was the very charter of liberty. It puts us under a
divine spell to perceive that we are all coworkers with the great men,
and yet single threads in the warp and woof of civilization. And
when books have related us to our own age, and related all the
epochs to God, whose providence is the gulf stream of history, these
teachers go on to stimulate us to new and greater achievements.
Alone, man is an unlighted candle. The mind needs some book to
kindle its faculties. Before Byron began to write he used to give half
an hour to reading some favorite passage. The thought of some great
writer never failed to kindle Byron into a creative glow, even as a
match lights the kindlings upon the grate. In these burning, luminous
moods Byron's mind did its best work. The true book stimulates the
mind as no wine can ever quicken the blood. It is reading that brings
us to our best, and rouses each faculty to its most vigorous life.
```

We recognize this as pure cream, and if it seems at first to have its secondary
source in the friendly milkman, let us not forget that the theme is "The Uses of
Books and Reading." Dr. Hillis both sees and thinks.

It is fashionable just now to decry the value of reading. We read, we are told, to
avoid the necessity of thinking for ourselves. Books are for the mentally lazy.

Though this is only a half-truth, the element of truth it contains is large enough
to make us pause. Put yourself through a good old Presbyterian soul-searching
self-examination, and if reading-from-thought-laziness is one of your sins,
confess it. No one can shrive you of it—but yourself. Do penance for it by using
your own brains, for it is a transgression that dwarfs the growth of thought and
destroys mental freedom. At first the penance will be trying—but at the last you
will be glad in it.

Reading should entertain, give information, or stimulate thought. Here, however,
we are chiefly concerned with information, and stimulation of thought.

What shall I read for information?

The ample page of knowledge, as Grey tells us, is "rich with the spoils of time,"
and these are ours for the price of a theatre ticket. You may command Socrates
and Marcus Aurelius to sit beside you and discourse of their choicest, hear
Lincoln at Gettysburg and Pericles at Athens, storm the Bastile with Hugo, and
wander through Paradise with Dante. You may explore darkest Africa with
Stanley, penetrate the human heart with Shakespeare, chat with Carlyle about
heroes, and delve with the Apostle Paul into the mysteries of faith. The general
knowledge and the inspiring ideas that men have collected through ages of toil
and experiment are yours for the asking. The Sage of Chelsea was right: "The
true university of these days is a collection of books."

To master a worth-while book is to master much else besides; few of us,
however, make perfect conquest of a volume without first owning it physically.
To read a borrowed book may be a joy, but to assign your own book a place of
its own on your own shelves—be they few or many—to love the book and feel
of its worn cover, to thumb it over slowly, page by page, to pencil its margins in
agreement or in protest, to smile or thrill with its remembered pungencies—no
mere book borrower could ever sense all that delight.

The reader who possesses books in this double sense finds also that his books
possess him, and the volumes which most firmly grip his life are likely to be
those it has cost him some sacrifice to own. These lightly-come-by titles, which
Mr. Fatpurse selects, perhaps by proxy, can scarcely play the guide, philosopher
and friend in crucial moments as do the books—long coveted, joyously attained
—that are welcomed into the lives, and not merely the libraries, of us others who
are at once poorer and richer.

So it is scarcely too much to say that of all the many ways in which an owned—
a mastered—book is like to a human friend, the truest ways are these: A friend is
worth making sacrifices for, both to gain and to keep; and our loves go out most
dearly to those into whose inmost lives we have sincerely entered.

When you have not the advantage of the test of time by which to judge books,
investigate as thoroughly as possible the authority of the books you read. Much
that is printed and passes current is counterfeit. "I read it in a book" is to many a
sufficient warranty of truth, but not to the thinker. "What book?" asks the careful
mind. "Who wrote it? What does he know about the subject and what right has
he to speak on it? Who recognizes him as authority? With what other recognized
authorities does he agree or disagree?" Being caught trying to pass counterfeit
money, even unintentionally, is an unpleasant situation. Beware lest you circulate

spurious coin.

Above all, seek reading that makes you use your own brains. Such reading must
be alive with fresh points of view, packed with special knowledge, and deal with
subjects of vital interest. Do not confine your reading to what you already know
you will agree with. Opposition wakes one up. The other road may be the better,
but you will never know it unless you "give it the once over." Do not do all your
thinking and investigating in front of given "Q.E.D.'s;" merely assembling
reasons to fill in between your theorem and what you want to prove will get you
nowhere. Approach each subject with an open mind and—once sure that you
have thought it out thoroughly and honestly—have the courage to abide by the
decision of your own thought. But don't brag about it afterward.

No book on public speaking will enable you to discourse on the tariff if you
know nothing about the tariff. Knowing more about it than the other man will be
your only hope for making the other man listen to you.

Take a group of men discussing a governmental policy of which some one says:
"It is socialistic." That will commend the policy to Mr. A., who believes in
socialism, but condemn it to Mr. B., who does not. It may be that neither had
considered the policy beyond noticing that its surface-color was socialistic. The
chances are, furthermore, that neither Mr. A. nor Mr. B. has a definite idea of
what socialism really is, for as Robert Louis Stevenson says, "Man lives not by
bread alone but chiefly by catch words." If you are of this group of men, and
have observed this proposed government policy, and investigated it, and thought
about it, what you have to say cannot fail to command their respect and
approval, for you will have shown them that you possess a grasp of your subject
and—to adopt an exceedingly expressive bit of slang—_then_ some.

SUBJECT AND PREPARATION

```
Suit your topics to your strength,
And ponder well your subject, and its length;
Nor lift your load, before you're quite aware
What weight your shoulders will, or will not, bear.
```

```
—BYRON, Hints from Horace.
```

```
Look to this day, for it is life—the very life of life. In its brief course
lie all the verities and realities of your existence: the bliss of growth,
```

```
the glory of action, the splendor of beauty. For yesterday is already a
dream and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well lived, makes
every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision
of hope. Look well, therefore, to this day. Such is the salutation of
the dawn.
```

```
—From the Sanskrit.
```

In the chapter preceding we have seen the influence of "Thought and Reserve
Power" on general preparedness for public speech. But preparation consists in
something more definite than the cultivation of thought-power, whether from
original or from borrowed sources—it involves a _specifically_ acquisitive attitude
of the whole life. If you would become a full soul you must constantly take in
and assimilate, for in that way only may you hope to give out that which is worth
the hearing; but do not confuse the acquisition of general information with the
mastery of specific knowledge. Information consists of a fact or a group of facts;
knowledge is _organized_ information—knowledge knows a fact in relation to
other facts.

Now the important thing here is that you should set all your faculties to take in
the things about you with the particular object of correlating them and storing
them for use in public speech. You must hear with the speaker's ear, see with the
speaker's eye, and choose books and companions and sights and sounds with the
speaker's purpose in view. At the same time, be ready to receive unplanned-for
knowledge. One of the fascinating elements in your life as a public speaker will
be the conscious growth in power that casual daily experiences bring. If your
eyes are alert you will be constantly discovering facts, illustrations, and ideas
without having set out in search of them. These all may be turned to account on
the platform; even the leaden events of hum-drum daily life may be melted into
bullets for future battles.

_Conservation of Time in Preparation_

But, you say, I have so little time for preparation—my mind must be absorbed by
other matters. Daniel Webster never let an opportunity pass to gather material for
his speeches. When he was a boy working in a sawmill he read out of a book in
one hand and busied himself at some mechanical task with the other. In youth
Patrick Henry roamed the fields and woods in solitude for days at a time
unconsciously gathering material and impressions for his later service as a
speaker. Dr. Russell H. Conwell, the man who, the late Charles A. Dana said,

had addressed more hearers than any living man, used to memorize long
passages from Milton while tending the boiling syrup-pans in the silent New
England woods at night. The modern employer would discharge a Webster of
today for inattention to duty, and doubtless he would be justified, and Patrick
Henry seemed only an idle chap even in those easy-going days; but the truth
remains: those who take in power and have the purpose to use it efficiently will
some day win to the place in which that stored-up power will revolve great
wheels of influence.

Napoleon said that quarter hours decide the destinies of nations. How many
quarter hours do we let drift by aimlessly! Robert Louis Stevenson conserved _all_
his time; _every_ experience became capital for his work—for capital may be
defined as "the results of labor stored up to assist future production." He
continually tried to put into suitable language the scenes and actions that were in
evidence about him. Emerson says: "Tomorrow will be like today. Life wastes
itself whilst we are preparing to live."

Why wait for a more convenient season for this broad, general preparation? The
fifteen minutes that we spend on the car could be profitably turned into speech-
capital.

Procure a cheap edition of modern speeches, and by cutting out a few pages each
day, and reading them during the idle minute here and there, note how soon you
can make yourself familiar with the world's best speeches. If you do not wish to
mutilate your book, take it with you—most of the epoch-making books are now
printed in small volumes. The daily waste of natural gas in the Oklahoma fields
is equal to ten thousand tons of coal. Only about three per cent of the power of
the coal that enters the furnace ever diffuses itself from your electric bulb as
light—the other ninety-seven per cent is wasted. Yet these wastes are no larger,
nor more to be lamented than the tremendous waste of time which, if conserved
would increase the speaker's powers to their _nth_ degree. Scientists are making
three ears of corn grow where one grew before; efficiency engineers are
eliminating useless motions and products from our factories: catch the spirit of
the age and apply efficiency to the use of the most valuable asset you possess—
time. What do you do mentally with the time you spend in dressing or in
shaving? Take some subject and concentrate your energies on it for a week by
utilizing just the spare moments that would otherwise be wasted. You will be
amazed at the result. One passage a day from the Book of Books, one golden
ingot from some master mind, one fully-possessed thought of your own might
thus be added to the treasury of your life. Do not waste your time in ways that

profit you nothing. Fill "the unforgiving minute" with "sixty seconds' worth of
distance run" and on the platform you will be immeasurably the gainer.

Let no word of this, however, seem to decry the value of recreation. Nothing is
more vital to a worker than rest—yet nothing is so vitiating to the shirker. Be
sure that your recreation re-creates. A pause in the midst of labors gathers
strength for new effort. The mistake is to pause too long, or to fill your pauses
with ideas that make life flabby.

_Choosing a Subject_

Subject and materials tremendously influence each other.

"This arises from the fact that there are two distinct ways in which a subject may
be chosen: by arbitrary choice, or by development from thought and reading.

"Arbitrary choice... of one subject from among a number involves so many
important considerations that no speaker ever fails to appreciate the tone of
satisfaction in him who triumphantly announces: 'I have a subject!'

"'Do give me a subject!' How often the weary school teacher hears that cry. Then
a list of themes is suggested, gone over, considered, and, in most instances,
rejected, because the teacher can know but imperfectly what is in the pupil's
mind. To suggest a subject in this way is like trying to discover the street on
which a lost child lives, by naming over a number of streets until one strikes the
little one's ear as sounding familiar.

"Choice by development is a very different process. It does not ask, What shall I
say? It turns the mind in upon itself and asks, What do I think? Thus, the subject
may be said to choose itself, for in the process of thought or of reading one
theme rises into prominence and becomes a living germ, soon to grow into the
discourse. He who has not learned to reflect is not really acquainted with his
own thoughts; hence, his thoughts are not productive. Habits of reading and
reflection will supply the speaker's mind with an abundance of subjects of which
he already knows something from the very reading and reflection which gave
birth to his theme. This is not a paradox, but sober truth.

"It must be already apparent that the choice of a subject by development savors
more of collection than of conscious selection. The subject 'pops into the mind.'

... In the intellect of the trained thinker it concentrates—by a process which we
have seen to be induction—the facts and truths of which he has been reading and

thinking. This is most often a gradual process. The scattered ideas may be but
vaguely connected at first, but more and more they concentrate and take on a
single form until at length one strong idea seems to grasp the soul with
irresistible force, and to cry aloud, 'Arise, I am your _theme_! Henceforth, until
you transmute me by the alchemy of your inward fire into vital speech, you shall
know no rest!' Happy, then, is that speaker, for he has found a subject that grips
him.

"Of course, experienced speakers use both methods of selection. Even a reading
and reflective man is sometimes compelled to hunt for a theme from Dan to
Beersheba, and then the task of gathering materials becomes a serious one. But
even in such a case there is a sense in which the selection comes by
development, because no careful speaker settles upon a theme which does not

represent at least some matured thought."[[^1][^0]]

_Deciding on the Subject Matter_

Even when your theme has been chosen for you by someone else, there remains
to you a considerable field for choice of subject matter. The same considerations,
in fact, that would govern you in choosing a theme must guide in the selection of
the material. Ask yourself—or someone else—such questions as these:

What is the precise nature of the occasion? How large an audience may be
expected? From what walks of life do they come? What is their probable attitude
toward the theme? Who else will speak? Do I speak first, last, or where, on the
program? What are the other speakers going to talk about? What is the nature of
the auditorium? Is there a desk? Could the subject be more effectively handled if
somewhat modified? Precisely how much time am I to fill?

It is evident that many speech-misfits of subject, speaker, occasion and place are
due to failure to ask just such pertinent questions. _What_ should be said, by
_whom_, and _in what circumstances_, constitute ninety per cent of efficiency in
public address. No matter who asks you, refuse to be a square peg in a round
hole.

_Questions of Proportion_

Proportion in a speech is attained by a nice adjustment of time. How fully you
may treat your subject it is not always for you to say. Let ten minutes mean
neither nine nor eleven—though better nine than eleven, at all events. You
wouldn't steal a man's watch; no more should you steal the time of the

succeeding speaker, or that of the audience. There is no need to overstep time-
limits if you make your preparation adequate and divide your subject so as to
give each thought its due proportion of attention—and no more. Blessed is the
man that maketh short speeches, for he shall be invited to speak again.

Another matter of prime importance is, what part of your address demands the
most emphasis. This once decided, you will know where to place that pivotal
section so as to give it the greatest strategic value, and what degree of
preparation must be given to that central thought so that the vital part may not be
submerged by non-essentials. Many a speaker has awakened to find that he has
burnt up eight minutes of a ten-minute speech in merely getting up steam. That
is like spending eighty percent of your building-money on the vestibule of the
house.

The same sense of proportion must tell you to stop precisely when you are
through—and it is to be hoped that you will discover the arrival of that period
before your audience does.

_Tapping Original Sources_

The surest way to give life to speech-material is to gather your facts at first hand.
Your words come with the weight of authority when you can say, "I have
examined the employment rolls of every mill in this district and find that thirty-
two per cent of the children employed are under the legal age." No citation of
authorities can equal that. You must adopt the methods of the reporter and find
out the facts underlying your argument or appeal. To do so may prove laborious,
but it should not be irksome, for the great world of fact teems with interest, and
over and above all is the sense of power that will come to you from original
investigation. To see and feel the facts you are discussing will react upon you
much more powerfully than if you were to secure the facts at second hand.

Live an active life among people who are doing worth-while things, keep eyes
and ears and mind and heart open to absorb truth, and then tell of the things you
know, as if you know them. The world will listen, for the world loves nothing so
much as real life.

_How to Use a Library_

Unsuspected treasures lie in the smallest library. Even when the owner has read
every last page of his books it is only in rare instances that he has full indexes to
all of them, either in his mind or on paper, so as to make available the vast

number of varied subjects touched upon or treated in volumes whose titles would
never suggest such topics.

For this reason it is a good thing to take an odd hour now and then to browse.
Take down one volume after another and look over its table of contents and its
index. (It is a reproach to any author of a serious book not to have provided a full
index, with cross references.) Then glance over the pages, making notes, mental
or physical, of material that looks interesting and usable. Most libraries contain
volumes that the owner is "going to read some day." A familiarity with even the
contents of such books on your own shelves will enable you to refer to them
when you want help. Writings read long ago should be treated in the same way
—in every chapter some surprise lurks to delight you.

In looking up a subject do not be discouraged if you do not find it indexed or
outlined in the table of contents—you are pretty sure to discover some material
under a related title.

Suppose you set to work somewhat in this way to gather references on
"Thinking:" First you look over your book titles, and there is Schaeffer's
"Thinking and Learning to Think." Near it is Kramer's "Talks to Students on the
Art of Study"—that seems likely to provide some material, and it does. Naturally
you think next of your book on psychology, and there is help there. If you have a
volume on the human intellect you will have already turned to it. Suddenly you
remember your encyclopedia and your dictionary of quotations—and now
material fairly rains upon you; the problem is what _not_ to use. In the
encyclopedia you turn to every reference that includes or touches or even
suggests "thinking;" and in the dictionary of quotations you do the same. The
latter volume you find peculiarly helpful because it suggests several volumes to
you that are on your own shelves—you never would have thought to look in
them for references on this subject. Even fiction will supply help, but especially
books of essays and biography. Be aware of your own resources.

To make a general index to your library does away with the necessity for
indexing individual volumes that are not already indexed.

To begin with, keep a note-book by you; or small cards and paper cuttings in
your pocket and on your desk will serve as well. The same note-book that
records the impressions of your own experiences and thoughts will be enriched
by the ideas of others.

To be sure, this note-book habit means labor, but remember that more speeches

have been spoiled by half-hearted preparation than by lack of talent. Laziness is
an own-brother to Over-confidence, and both are your inveterate enemies,
though they pretend to be soothing friends.

Conserve your material by indexing every good idea on cards, thus:

```
Socialism
Progress of S., Env. 16
S. a fallacy, 96/210
General article on S., Howells', Dec. 1913
"Socialism and the Franchise," Forbes
"Socialism in Ancient Life," Original Ms.,
Env. 102
```

On the card illustrated above, clippings are indexed by giving the number of the
envelope in which they are filed. The envelopes may be of any size desired and
kept in any convenient receptacle. On the foregoing example, "Progress of S.,
Envelope [^1]:[^6]:," will represent a clipping, filed in Envelope [^1]:[^6]:, which is, of
course, numbered arbitrarily.

The fractions refer to books in your library—the numerator being the book-
number, the denominator referring to the page. Thus, "S. a fallacy, [^9]:[^6]:/[^2]:[^1]:[^0]:,"
refers to page [^2]:[^1]:[^0]: of volume [^9]:[^6]: in your library. By some arbitrary sign—say red
ink—you may even index a reference in a public library book.

If you preserve your magazines, important articles may be indexed by month and
year. An entire volume on a subject may be indicated like the imaginary book by
"Forbes." If you clip the articles, it is better to index them according to the
envelope system.

Your own writings and notes may be filed in envelopes with the clippings or in a
separate series.

Another good indexing system combines the library index with the "scrap," or
clipping, system by making the outside of the envelope serve the same purpose
as the card for the indexing of books, magazines, clippings and manuscripts, the
latter two classes of material being enclosed in the envelopes that index them,
and all filed alphabetically.

When your cards accumulate so as to make ready reference difficult under a

single alphabet, you may subdivide each letter by subordinate guide cards
marked by the vowels, A, E, I, O, U. Thus, "Antiquities" would be filed under _i_
in A, because A begins the word, and the second letter, _n_, comes after the vowel _i_
in the alphabet, but before _o_. In the same manner, "Beecher" would be filed
under _e_ in B; and "Hydrogen" would come under _u_ in H.

_Outlining the Address_

No one can advise you how to prepare the notes for an address. Some speakers
get the best results while walking out and ruminating, jotting down notes as they
pause in their walk. Others never put pen to paper until the whole speech has
been thought out. The great majority, however, will take notes, classify their
notes, write a hasty first draft, and then revise the speech. Try each of these
methods and choose the one that is best—_for you_. Do not allow any man to force
you to work in _his_ way; but do not neglect to consider his way, for it may be
better than your own.

For those who make notes and with their aid write out the speech, these
suggestions may prove helpful:

After having read and thought enough, classify your notes by setting down the
big, central thoughts of your material on separate cards or slips of paper. These
will stand in the same relation to your subject as chapters do to a book.

Then arrange these main ideas or heads in such an order that they will lead
effectively to the result you have in mind, so that the speech may rise in
argument, in interest, in power, by piling one fact or appeal upon another until
the climax—the highest point of influence on your audience—has been reached.

Next group all your ideas, facts, anecdotes, and illustrations under the foregoing
main heads, each where it naturally belongs.

You now have a skeleton or outline of your address that in its polished form
might serve either as the brief, or manuscript notes, for the speech or as the
guide-outline which you will expand into the written address, if written it is to
be.

Imagine each of the main ideas in the brief on page [^2]:[^1]:[^3]: as being separate; then
picture your mind as sorting them out and placing them in order; finally,
conceive of how you would fill in the facts and examples under each head,
giving special prominence to those you wish to emphasize and subduing those of

less moment. In the end, you have the outline complete. The simplest form of
outline—not very suitable for use on the platform, however—is the following:

_WHY PROSPERITY IS COMING_

What prosperity means.—The real tests of prosperity.—Its basis in the soil.—
American agricultural progress.—New interest in farming.—Enormous value of
our agricultural products.—Reciprocal effect on trade.—Foreign countries
affected.—Effects of our new internal economy—the regulation of banking and
"big business"—on prosperity.—Effects of our revised attitude toward foreign
markets, including our merchant marine.—Summary.

Obviously, this very simple outline is capable of considerable expansion under
each head by the addition of facts, arguments, inferences and examples.

Here is an outline arranged with more regard for argument:

```
FOREIGN IMMIGRATION SHOULD BE RESTRICTED[[^1][^1]]
```

```
I. FACT AS CAUSE: Many immigrants are practically paupers. (Proofs
involving statistics or statements of authorities.)
```

```
II. FACT AS EFFECT: They sooner or later fill our alms-houses and
become public charges. (Proofs involving statistics or statements of
authorities.)
```

```
III. FACT AS CAUSE: Some of them are criminals. (Examples of
recent cases.)
```

```
IV. FACT AS EFFECT: They reënforce the criminal classes. (Effects on
our civic life.)
```

```
V. FACT AS CAUSE: Many of them know nothing of the duties of free
citizenship. (Examples.)
```

```
VI.FACT AS EFFECT: Such immigrants recruit the worst element in
our politics. (Proofs.)
```

A more highly ordered grouping of topics and subtopics is shown in the
following:

```
OURS A CHRISTIAN NATION
```

```
I. INTRODUCTION: Why the subject is timely. Influences operative
against this contention today.
```

```
II. CHRISTIANITY PRESIDED OVER THE EARLY HISTORY
OF AMERICA.
```

```
1. First practical discovery by a Christian explorer. Columbus
worshiped God on the new soil.
```

```
2. The Cavaliers.
```

```
3. The French Catholic settlers.
```

```
4. The Huguenots.
```

```
5. The Puritans.
```

```
III. THE BIRTH OF OUR NATION WAS UNDER CHRISTIAN AUSPICES.
```

```
1. Christian character of Washington.
```

```
2. Other Christian patriots.
```

```
3. The Church in our Revolutionary struggle. Muhlenberg.
```

```
IV. OUR LATER HISTORY HAS ONLY EMPHASIZED OUR
NATIONAL ATTITUDE. Examples of dealings with foreign nations
show Christian magnanimity. Returning the Chinese Indemnity;
fostering the Red Cross; attitude toward Belgium.
```

```
V. OUR GOVERNMENTAL FORMS AND MANY OF OUR
LAWS ARE OF A CHRISTIAN TEMPER.
```

```
1. The use of the Bible in public ways, oaths, etc.
```

```
2. The Bible in our schools.
```

```
3. Christian chaplains minister to our law-making bodies, to our
army, and to our navy.
```

```
4. The Christian Sabbath is officially and generally recognized.
```

```
5. The Christian family and the Christian system of morality are at
the basis of our laws.
```

```
VI. THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE TESTIFIES OF THE POWER OF
CHRISTIANITY. Charities, education, etc., have Christian tone.
```

```
VII. OTHER NATIONS REGARD US AS A CHRISTIAN PEOPLE.
```

```
VIII. CONCLUSION: The attitude which may reasonably be expected of
all good citizens toward questions touching the preservation of our
standing as a Christian nation.
```

_Writing and Revision_

After the outline has been perfected comes the time to write the speech, if write
it you must. Then, whatever you do, write it at white heat, with not _too_ much
thought of anything but the strong, appealing expression of your ideas.

The final stage is the paring down, the re-vision—the seeing again, as the word

implies—when all the parts of the speech must be impartially scrutinized for
clearness, precision, force, effectiveness, suitability, proportion, logical climax;
and in all this you must _imagine yourself to be before your audience_, for a
speech is not an essay and what will convince and arouse in the one will not
prevail in the other.

_The Title_

Often last of all will come that which in a sense is first of all—the title, the name
by which the speech is known. Sometimes it will be the simple theme of the
address, as "The New Americanism," by Henry Watterson; or it may be a bit of
symbolism typifying the spirit of the address, as "Acres of Diamonds," by
Russell H. Conwell; or it may be a fine phrase taken from the body of the
address, as "Pass Prosperity Around," by Albert J. Beveridge. All in all, from
whatever motive it be chosen, let the title be fresh, short, suited to the subject,
and likely to excite interest.

INFLUENCING BY EXPOSITION
```

```
Speak not at all, in any wise, till you have somewhat to speak; care

```

```
—THOMAS CARLYLE, Essay on Biography.
```

A complete discussion of the rhetorical structure of public speeches requires a
fuller treatise than can be undertaken in a work of this nature, yet in this chapter,
and in the succeeding ones on "Description," "Narration," "Argument," and
"Pleading," the underlying principles are given and explained as fully as need be
for a working knowledge, and adequate book references are given for those who
would perfect themselves in rhetorical art.

_The Nature of Exposition_

In the word "expose"—_to lay bare, to uncover, to show the true inwardness of_—
we see the foundation-idea of "Exposition." It is the clear and precise setting
forth of what the subject really is—it is explanation.

Exposition does not draw a picture, for that would be description. To tell in exact
terms what the automobile is, to name its characteristic parts and explain their
workings, would be exposition; so would an explanation of the nature of "fear."
But to create a mental image of a particular automobile, with its glistening body,
graceful lines, and great speed, would be description; and so would a picturing
of fear acting on the emotions of a child at night. Exposition and description
often intermingle and overlap, but fundamentally they are distinct. Their
differences will be touched upon again in the chapter on "Description."

Exposition furthermore does not include an account of how events happened—
that is narration. When Peary lectured on his polar discoveries he explained the
instruments used for determining latitude and longitude—that was exposition. In
picturing his equipment he used description. In telling of his adventures day by
day he employed narration. In supporting some of his contentions he used
argument. Yet he mingled all these forms throughout the lecture.

Neither does exposition deal with reasons and inferences—that is the field of
argument. A series of connected statements intended to convince a prospective
buyer that one automobile is better than another, or proofs that the appeal to fear
is a wrong method of discipline, would not be exposition. The plain facts as set
forth in expository speaking or writing are nearly always the basis of argument,
yet the processes are not one. True, the statement of a single significant fact
without the addition of one other word may be convincing, but a moment's
thought will show that the inference, which completes a chain of reasoning, is
made in the mind of the hearer and presupposes other facts held in consideration.
[[^1]:[^2]:]

In like manner, it is obvious that the field of persuasion is not open to exposition,
for exposition is entirely an intellectual process, with no emotional element.

_The Importance of Exposition_

The importance of exposition in public speech is precisely the importance of
setting forth a matter so plainly that it cannot be misunderstood.

```
"To master the process of exposition is to become a clear thinker. 'I
know, when you do not ask me,'[[^1][^3]] replied a gentleman upon being
requested to define a highly complex idea. Now some large concepts
defy explicit definition; but no mind should take refuge behind such
exceptions, for where definition fails, other forms succeed.
Sometimes we feel confident that we have perfect mastery of an
idea, but when the time comes to express it, the clearness becomes a
haze. Exposition, then, is the test of clear understanding. To speak
effectively you must be able to see your subject clearly and
comprehensively, and to make your audience see it as you do."[[^1][^4]]
```

There are pitfalls on both sides of this path. To explain too little will leave your
audience in doubt as to what you mean. It is useless to argue a question if it is
not perfectly clear just what is meant by the question. Have you never come to a
blind lane in conversation by finding that you were talking of one aspect of a
matter while your friend was thinking of another? If two do not agree in their
definitions of a Musician, it is useless to dispute over a certain man's right to
claim the title.

On the other side of the path lies the abyss of tediously explaining too much.
That offends because it impresses the hearers that you either do not respect their
intelligence or are trying to blow a breeze into a tornado. Carefully estimate the

probable knowledge of your audience, both in general and of the particular point
you are explaining. In trying to simplify, it is fatal to "sillify." To explain more
than is needed for the purposes of your argument or appeal is to waste energy all
around. In your efforts to be explicit do not press exposition to the extent of
dulness—the confines are not far distant and you may arrive before you know it.

_Some Purposes of Exposition_

From what has been said it ought to be clear that, primarily, exposition weaves a
cord of understanding between you and your audience. It lays, furthermore, a
foundation of fact on which to build later statements, arguments, and appeals. In
scientific and purely "information" speeches exposition may exist by itself and
for itself, as in a lecture on biology, or on psychology; but in the vast majority of
cases it is used to accompany and prepare the way for the other forms of
discourse.

Clearness, precision, accuracy, unity, truth, and necessity—these must be the
_constant_ standards by which you test the efficiency of your expositions, and,
indeed, that of every explanatory statement. This dictum should be written on
your brain in letters most plain. And let this apply not alone to the _purposes_ of
exposition but in equal measure to your use of the

_Methods of Exposition_

The various ways along which a speaker may proceed in exposition are likely to
touch each other now and then, and even when they do not meet and actually
overlap they run so nearly parallel that the roads are sometimes distinct rather in
theory than in any more practical respect.

**Definition**, the primary expository method, is a statement of precise limits.[[^1][^5]]
Obviously, here the greatest care must be exercised that the terms of definition
should not themselves demand too much definition; that the language should be
concise and clear; and that the definition should neither exclude nor include too
much. The following is a simple example:

```
To expound is to set forth the nature, the significance, the
characteristics, and the bearing of an idea or a group of ideas.
```

```
—ARLO BATES, Talks on Writing English.
```

**Contrast and Antithesis** are often used effectively to amplify definition, as in
this sentence, which immediately follows the above-cited definition:

```
Exposition therefore differs from Description in that it deals directly
with the meaning or intent of its subject instead of with its
appearance.
```

This antithesis forms an expansion of the definition, and as such it might have
been still further extended. In fact, this is a frequent practise in public speech,
where the minds of the hearers often ask for reiteration and expanded statement
to help them grasp a subject in its several aspects. This is the very heart of
exposition—to amplify and clarify all the terms by which a matter is defined.

**Example** is another method of amplifying a definition or of expounding an idea
more fully. The following sentences immediately succeed Mr. Bates's definition
and contrast just quoted:

```
A good deal which we are accustomed inexactly to call description is
really exposition. Suppose that your small boy wishes to know how
an engine works, and should say: "Please describe the steam-engine
to me." If you insist on taking his words literally—and are willing to
run the risk of his indignation at being wilfully misunderstood—you
will to the best of your ability picture to him this familiarly
wonderful machine. If you explain it to him, you are not describing
but expounding it.
```

The chief value of example is that it makes clear the unknown by referring the
mind to the known. Readiness of mind to make illuminating, apt comparisons for
the sake of clearness is one of the speaker's chief resources on the platform—it is
the greatest of all teaching gifts. It is a gift, moreover, that responds to
cultivation. Read the three extracts from Arlo Bates as their author delivered
them, as one passage, and see how they melt into one, each part supplementing
the other most helpfully.

**Analogy**, which calls attention to similar relationships in objects not otherwise
similar, is one of the most useful methods of exposition. The following striking
specimen is from Beecher's Liverpool speech:

```
A savage is a man of one story, and that one story a cellar. When a
man begins to be civilized he raises another story. When you
christianize and civilize the man, you put story upon story, for you
develop faculty after faculty; and you have to supply every story
with your productions.
```

**Discarding** is a less common form of platform explanation. It consists in
clearing away associated ideas so that the attention may be centered on the main
thought to be discussed. Really, it is a negative factor in exposition though a
most important one, for it is fundamental to the consideration of an intricately
related matter that subordinate and side questions should be set aside in order to
bring out the main issue. Here is an example of the method:

```
I cannot allow myself to be led aside from the only issue before this
jury. It is not pertinent to consider that this prisoner is the husband of
a heartbroken woman and that his babes will go through the world
under the shadow of the law's extremest penalty worked upon their
father. We must forget the venerable father and the mother whom
Heaven in pity took before she learned of her son's disgrace. What
have these matters of heart, what have the blenched faces of his
friends, what have the prisoner's long and honorable career to say
before this bar when you are sworn to weigh only the direct
evidence before you? The one and only question for you to decide
on the evidence is whether this man did with revengeful intent
commit the murder that every impartial witness has solemnly laid at
his door.
```

**Classification** assigns a subject to its class. By an allowable extension of the
definition it may be said to assign it also to its order, genus, and species.
Classification is useful in public speech in narrowing the issue to a desired
phase. It is equally valuable for showing a thing in its relation to other things, or
in correlation. Classification is closely akin to Definition and Division.

```
This question of the liquor traffic, sirs, takes its place beside the
grave moral issues of all times. Whatever be its economic
significance—and who is there to question it—whatever vital
bearing it has upon our political system—and is there one who will
deny it?—the question of the licensed saloon must quickly be settled
as the world in its advancement has settled the questions of
constitutional government for the masses, of the opium traffic, of the
serf, and of the slave—not as matters of economic and political
expediency but as questions of right and wrong.
```

**Analysis** separates a subject into its essential parts. This it may do by various
principles; for example, analysis may follow the order of time (geologic eras),
order of place (geographic facts), logical order (a sermon outline), order of

increasing interest, or procession to a climax (a lecture on [^2]:[^0]:th century poets);
and so on. A classic example of analytical exposition is the following:

```
In philosophy the contemplations of man do either penetrate unto
God, or are circumferred to nature, or are reflected or reverted upon
himself. Out of which several inquiries there do arise three
knowledges: divine philosophy, natural philosophy, and human
philosophy or humanity. For all things are marked and stamped with
this triple character, of the power of God, the difference of nature,
and the use of man.
```

```
—LORD BACON, The Advancement of Learning.[[^1][^6]]
```

**Division** differs only from analysis in that analysis follows the inherent divisions
of a subject, as illustrated in the foregoing passage, while division arbitrarily
separates the subject for convenience of treatment, as in the following none-too-
logical example:

```
For civil history, it is of three kinds; not unfitly to be compared with
the three kinds of pictures or images. For of pictures or images, we
see some are unfinished, some are perfect, and some are defaced. So
of histories we may find three kinds, memorials, perfect histories,
and antiquities; for memorials are history unfinished, or the first or
rough drafts of history; and antiquities are history defaced, or some
remnants of history which have casually escaped the shipwreck of
time.
```

```
—LORD BACON, The Advancement of Learning.[[^1][^6]A]
```

**Generalization** states a broad principle, or a general truth, derived from
examination of a considerable number of individual facts. This synthetic
exposition is not the same as argumentative generalization, which supports a
general contention by citing instances in proof. Observe how Holmes begins
with one fact, and by adding another and another reaches a complete whole. This
is one of the most effective devices in the public speaker's repertory.

```
Take a hollow cylinder, the bottom closed while the top remains
open, and pour in water to the height of a few inches. Next cover the
water with a flat plate or piston, which fits the interior of the
cylinder perfectly; then apply heat to the water, and we shall witness
the following phenomena. After the lapse of some minutes the water
```

```
will begin to boil, and the steam accumulating at the upper surface
will make room for itself by raising the piston slightly. As the
boiling continues, more and more steam will be formed, and raise
the piston higher and higher, till all the water is boiled away, and
nothing but steam is left in the cylinder. Now this machine,
consisting of cylinder, piston, water, and fire, is the steam-engine in
its most elementary form. For a steam-engine may be defined as an
apparatus for doing work by means of heat applied to water; and
since raising such a weight as the piston is a form of doing work,
this apparatus, clumsy and inconvenient though it may be, answers
the definition precisely.[[^1][^7]]
```

**Reference to Experience** is one of the most vital principles in exposition—as in
every other form of discourse.

"Reference to experience, as here used, means reference to the known. The
known is that which the listener has seen, heard, read, felt, believed or done, and
which still exists in his consciousness—his stock of knowledge. It embraces all
those thoughts, feelings and happenings which are to him real. Reference to

Experience, then, means _coming into the listener's life_.[[^1][^8]]

```
The vast results obtained by science are won by no mystical
faculties, by no mental processes, other than those which are
practised by every one of us in the humblest and meanest affairs of
life. A detective policeman discovers a burglar from the marks made
by his shoe, by a mental process identical with that by which Cuvier
restored the extinct animals of Montmartre from fragments of their
bones. Nor does that process of induction and deduction by which a
lady, finding a stain of a particular kind upon her dress, concludes
that somebody has upset the inkstand thereon, differ in any way
from that by which Adams and Leverrier discovered a new planet.
The man of science, in fact, simply uses with scrupulous exactness
the methods which we all habitually, and at every moment, use
carelessly.

chin double? your wit single? and every part about you blasted with
antiquity? and will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir
John!
```

```
—SHAKESPEARE, The Merry Wives of Windsor.
```

Finally, in preparing expository material ask yourself these questions regarding
your subject:

What is it, and what is it not?
What is it like, and unlike?
What are its causes, and effects?
How shall it be divided?
With what subjects is it correlated?
What experiences does it recall?
What examples illustrate it?

INFLUENCING BY DESCRIPTION
```

```
The groves of Eden vanish'd now so long,
Live in description, and look green in song.
```

```
—ALEXANDER POPE, Windsor Forest.
```

```
The moment our discourse rises above the ground-line of familiar
facts, and is inflamed with passion or exalted thought, it clothes
itself in images. A man conversing in earnest, if he watch his
intellectual processes, will find that always a material image, more
or less luminous, arises in his mind, contemporaneous with every
thought, which furnishes the vestment of the thought.... This
imagery is spontaneous. It is the blending of experience with the
present action of the mind. It is proper creation.—RALPH WALDO
EMERSON, Nature.
```

Like other valuable resources in public speaking, description loses its power
when carried to an extreme. Over-ornamentation makes the subject ridiculous. A
dust-cloth is a very useful thing, but why embroider it? Whether description

shall be restrained within its proper and important limits, or be encouraged to run
riot, is the personal choice that comes before every speaker, for man's earliest
literary tendency is to depict.

_The Nature of Description_

To describe is to call up a picture in the mind of the hearer. "In talking of
description we naturally speak of portraying, delineating, coloring, and all the
devices of the picture painter. To describe is to visualize, hence we must look at
description as a pictorial process, whether the writer deals with material or with

spiritual objects."[[^1][^9]]

If you were asked to describe the rapid-fire gun you might go about it in either of
two ways: give a cold technical account of its mechanism, in whole and in detail,
or else describe it as a terrible engine of slaughter, dwelling upon its effects
rather than upon its structure.

The former of these processes is exposition, the latter is true description.
Exposition deals more with the _general_, while description must deal with the
_particular_. Exposition elucidates _ideas_, description treats of _things_. Exposition
deals with the _abstract_, description with the _concrete_. Exposition is concerned
with the _internal_, description with the _external_. Exposition is _enumerative_,
description _literary_. Exposition is _intellectual_, description _sensory_. Exposition is
_impersonal_, description _personal_.

If description is a visualizing process for the hearer, it is first of all such for the
speaker—he cannot describe what he has never seen, either physically or in
fancy. It is this personal quality—this question of the personal eye which sees
the things later to be described—that makes description so interesting in public
speech. Given a speaker of personality, and we are interested in his personal
view—his view adds to the natural interest of the scene, and may even be the
sole source of that interest to his auditors.

The seeing eye has been praised in an earlier chapter (on "Subject and
Preparation") and the imagination will be treated in a subsequent one (on
"Riding the Winged Horse"), but here we must consider the _picturing mind_: the
mind that forms the double habit of seeing things clearly—for we see more with
the mind than we do with the physical eye—and then of re-imaging these things
for the purpose of getting them before the minds' eyes of the hearers. No habit is
more useful than that of visualizing clearly the object, the scene, the situation,
the action, the person, about to be described. Unless that primary process is

carried out clearly, the picture will be blurred for the hearer-beholder.

In a work of this nature we are concerned with the rhetorical analysis of
description, and with its methods, only so far as may be needed for the practical

purposes of the speaker.[[^2][^0]] The following grouping, therefore, will not be
regarded as complete, nor will it here be necessary to add more than a word of
explanation:

```
Description for Public Speakers
```

```
Objects { Still
Objects { In motion
Scenes { Still
Scenes { Including action
Situations { Preceding change
Situations { During change
Situations { After change
Actions { Mental
Actions {Physical
Persons { Internal
Persons { External
```

Some of the foregoing processes will overlap, in certain instances, and all are
more likely to be found in combination than singly.

When description is intended solely to give accurate information—as to
delineate the appearance, not the technical construction, of the latest Zeppelin
airship—it is called "scientific description," and is akin to exposition. When it is
intended to present a free picture for the purpose of making a vivid impression, it
is called "artistic description." With both of these the public speaker has to deal,
but more frequently with the latter form. Rhetoricians make still further
distinctions.

_Methods of Description_

In public speaking, _description should be mainly by suggestion_, not only because
suggestive description is so much more compact and time-saving but because it
is so vivid. Suggestive expressions connote more than they literally say—they
suggest ideas and pictures to the mind of the hearer which supplement the direct

words of the speaker. When Dickens, in his "Christmas Carol," says: "In came
Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile," our minds complete the picture so
deftly begun—a much more effective process than that of a minutely detailed
description because it leaves a unified, vivid impression, and that is what we
need. Here is a present-day bit of suggestion: "General Trinkle was a gnarly oak
of a man—rough, solid, and safe; you always knew where to find him." Dickens
presents Miss Peecher as: "A little pin-cushion, a little housewife, a little book, a
little work-box, a little set of tables and weights and measures, and a little
woman all in one." In his "Knickerbocker's" "History of New York," Irving
portrays Wouter van Twiller as "a robustious beer-barrel, standing on skids."

Whatever forms of description you neglect, be sure to master the art of
suggestion.

_Description may be by simple hint._ Lowell notes a happy instance of this sort of
picturing by intimation when he says of Chaucer: "Sometimes he describes
amply by the merest hint, as where the Friar, before setting himself down, drives
away the cat. We know without need of more words that he has chosen the
snuggest corner."

_Description may depict a thing by its effects._ "When the spectator's eye is
dazzled, and he shades it," says Mozley in his "Essays," "we form the idea of a
splendid object; when his face turns pale, of a horrible one; from his quick
wonder and admiration we form the idea of great beauty; from his silent awe, of
great majesty."

_Brief description may be by epithet._ "Blue-eyed," "white-armed," "laughter-
loving," are now conventional compounds, but they were fresh enough when
Homer first conjoined them. The centuries have not yet improved upon "Wheels
round, brazen, eight-spoked," or "Shields smooth, beautiful, brazen, well-
hammered." Observe the effective use of epithet in Will Levington Comfort's
"The Fighting Death," when he speaks of soldiers in a Philippine skirmish as
being "leeched against a rock."

_Description uses figures of speech._ Any advanced rhetoric will discuss their

forms and give examples for guidance.[[^2][^1]] This matter is most important, be
assured. A brilliant yet carefully restrained figurative style, a style marked by
brief, pungent, witty, and humorous comparisons and characterizations, is a
wonderful resource for all kinds of platform work.

_Description may be direct._ This statement is plain enough without exposition.

Use your own judgment as to whether in picturing you had better proceed from a
general view to the details, or first give the details and thus build up the general
picture, but by all means BE BRIEF.

Note the vivid compactness of these delineations from Washington Irving's
"Knickerbocker:"

```
He was a short, square, brawny old gentleman, with a double chin, a
mastiff mouth, and a broad copper nose, which was supposed in
those days to have acquired its fiery hue from the constant
neighborhood of his tobacco pipe.
```

```
He was exactly five feet six inches in height, and six feet five inches
in circumference. His head was a perfect sphere, and of such
stupendous dimensions, that Dame Nature, with all her sex's
ingenuity, would have been puzzled to construct a neck capable of
supporting it; wherefore she wisely declined the attempt, and settled
it firmly on the top of his backbone, just between the shoulders. His
body was of an oblong form, particularly capacious at bottom; which
was wisely ordered by Providence, seeing that he was a man of
sedentary habits, and very averse to the idle labor of walking.
```

The foregoing is too long for the platform, but it is so good-humored, so full of
delightful exaggeration, that it may well serve as a model of humorous character
picturing, for here one inevitably sees the inner man in the outer.

Direct description for platform use may be made vivid by the _sparing_ use of the
"historical present." The following dramatic passage, accompanied by the most
lively action, has lingered in the mind for thirty years after hearing Dr. T. De
Witt Talmage lecture on "Big Blunders." The crack of the bat sounds clear even
today:

```
Get ready the bats and take your positions. Now, give us the ball.
Too low. Don't strike. Too high. Don't strike. There it comes like
lightning. Strike! Away it soars! Higher! Higher! Run! Another
base! Faster! Faster! Good! All around at one stroke!
```

Observe the remarkable way in which the lecturer fused speaker, audience,
spectators, and players into one excited, ecstatic whole—just as you have found
yourself starting forward in your seat at the delivery of the ball with "three on
and two down" in the ninth inning. Notice, too, how—perhaps unconsciously—

Talmage painted the scene in Homer's characteristic style: not as having already
happened, but as happening before your eyes.

If you have attended many travel talks you must have been impressed by the
painful extremes to which the lecturers go—with a few notable exceptions, their
language is either over-ornate or crude. If you would learn the power of words to
make scenery, yes, even houses, palpitate with poetry and human appeal, read
Lafcadio Hearn, Robert Louis Stevenson, Pierre Loti, and Edmondo De Amicis.

```
Blue-distant, a mountain of carven stone appeared before them,—the
Temple, lifting to heaven its wilderness of chiseled pinnacles,
flinging to the sky the golden spray of its decoration.
```

```
—LAFCADIO HEARN, Chinese Ghosts.
```

```
The stars were clear, colored, and jewel-like, but not frosty. A faint
silvery vapour stood for the Milky Way. All around me the black fir-
points stood upright and stock-still. By the whiteness of the pack-
saddle I could see Modestine walking round and round at the length
of her tether; I could hear her steadily munching at the sward; but
there was not another sound save the indescribable quiet talk of the
runnel over the stones.

```
It was full autumn now, late autumn—with the nightfalls gloomy,
and all things growing dark early in the old cottage, and all the
Breton land looking sombre, too. The very days seemed but twilight;
immeasurable clouds, slowly passing, would suddenly bring
darkness at broad noon. The wind moaned constantly—it was like
the sound of a great cathedral organ at a distance, but playing
profane airs, or despairing dirges; at other times it would come close
to the door, and lift up a howl like wild beasts.—PIERRE LOTI, An
Iceland Fisherman.
```

```
I see the great refectory,[[^2][^2]] where a battalion might have drilled; I
see the long tables, the five hundred heads bent above the plates, the
rapid motion of five hundred forks, of a thousand hands, and sixteen
thousand teeth; the swarm of servants running here and there, called
to, scolded, hurried, on every side at once; I hear the clatter of
dishes, the deafening noise, the voices choked with food crying out:
"Bread—bread!" and I feel once more the formidable appetite, the
herculean strength of jaw, the exuberant life and spirits of those far-
off days.[[^2][^3]]

_Suggestions for the Use of Description_

Decide, on beginning a description, what point of view you wish your hearers to

take. One cannot see either a mountain or a man on all sides at once. Establish a
view-point, and do not shift without giving notice.

Choose an attitude toward your subject—shall it be idealized? caricatured?
ridiculed? exaggerated? defended? or described impartially?

Be sure of your mood, too, for it will color the subject to be described.
Melancholy will make a rose-garden look gray.

Adopt an order in which you will proceed—do not shift backward and forward
from near to far, remote to close in time, general to particular, large to small,
important to unimportant, concrete to abstract, physical to mental; but follow
your chosen order. Scattered and shifting observations produce hazy impressions
just as a moving camera spoils the time-exposure.

Do not go into needless minutiæ. Some details identify a thing with its class,
while other details differentiate it from its class. Choose only the significant,
suggestive characteristics and bring those out with terse vividness. Learn a
lesson from the few strokes used by the poster artist.

In determining what to describe and what merely to name, seek to read the
knowledge of your audience. The difference to them between the unknown and
the known is a vital one also to you.

Relentlessly cut out all ideas and words not necessary to produce the effect you
desire. Each element in a mental picture either helps or hinders. Be sure they do
not hinder, for they cannot be passively present in any discourse.

Interruptions of the description to make side-remarks are as powerful to destroy
unity as are scattered descriptive phrases. The only visual impression that can be
effective is one that is unified.

In describing, try to call up the emotions you felt when first you saw the scene,
and then try to reproduce those emotions in your hearers. Description is
primarily emotional in its appeal; nothing can be more deadly dull than a cold,
unemotional outline, while nothing leaves a warmer impression than a glowing,
spirited description.

Give a swift and vivid general view at the close of the portrayal. First and final
impressions remain the longest. The mind may be trained to take in the
characteristic points of a subject, so as to view in a single scene, action,
experience, or character, a unified impression of the whole. To describe a thing

as a whole you must first see it as a whole. Master that art and you have
mastered description to the last degree.

SELECTIONS FOR PRACTISE

```
THE HOMES OF THE PEOPLE
```

```
I went to Washington the other day, and I stood on the Capitol Hill;
my heart beat quick as I looked at the towering marble of my
country's Capitol and the mist gathered in my eyes as I thought of its
tremendous significance, and the armies and the treasury, and the
judges and the President, and the Congress and the courts, and all
that was gathered there. And I felt that the sun in all its course could
not look down on a better sight than that majestic home of a republic
that had taught the world its best lessons of liberty. And I felt that if
honor and wisdom and justice abided therein, the world would at last
owe to that great house in which the ark of the covenant of my
country is lodged, its final uplifting and its regeneration.
```

```
Two days afterward, I went to visit a friend in the country, a modest
man, with a quiet country home. It was just a simple, unpretentious
house, set about with big trees, encircled in meadow and field rich
with the promise of harvest. The fragrance of the pink and hollyhock
in the front yard was mingled with the aroma of the orchard and of
the gardens, and resonant with the cluck of poultry and the hum of
bees.
```

```
Inside was quiet, cleanliness, thrift, and comfort. There was the old
clock that had welcomed, in steady measure, every newcomer to the
family, that had ticked the solemn requiem of the dead, and had kept
company with the watcher at the bedside. There were the big, restful
beds and the old, open fireplace, and the old family Bible, thumbed
with the fingers of hands long since still, and wet with the tears of
eyes long since closed, holding the simple annals of the family and
the heart and the conscience of the home.
```

```
Outside, there stood my friend, the master, a simple, upright man,
with no mortgage on his roof, no lien on his growing crops, master
of his land and master of himself. There was his old father, an aged,
trembling man, but happy in the heart and home of his son. And as
they started to their home, the hands of the old man went down on
```

the young man's shoulder, laying there the unspeakable blessing of
the honored and grateful father and ennobling it with the knighthood
of the fifth commandment.

And as they reached the door the old mother came with the sunset
falling fair on her face, and lighting up her deep, patient eyes, while
her lips, trembling with the rich music of her heart, bade her
husband and son welcome to their home. Beyond was the housewife,
busy with her household cares, clean of heart and conscience, the
buckler and helpmeet of her husband. Down the lane came the
children, trooping home after the cows, seeking as truant birds do
the quiet of their home nest.

And I saw the night come down on that house, falling gently as the
wings of the unseen dove. And the old man—while a startled bird
called from the forest, and the trees were shrill with the cricket's cry,
and the stars were swarming in the sky—got the family around him,
and, taking the old Bible from the table, called them to their knees,
the little baby hiding in the folds of its mother's dress, while he
closed the record of that simple day by calling down God's
benediction on that family and that home. And while I gazed, the
vision of that marble Capitol faded. Forgotten were its treasures and
its majesty and I said, "Oh, surely here in the homes of the people
are lodged at last the strength and the responsibility of this
government, the hope and the promise of this republic."—HENRY W.
GRADY.

_SUGGESTIVE SCENES_

One thing in life calls for another; there is a fitness in events and
places. The sight of a pleasant arbor puts it in our mind to sit there.
One place suggests work, another idleness, a third early rising and
long rambles in the dew. The effect of night, of any flowing water,
of lighted cities, of the peep of day, of ships, of the open ocean, calls
up in the mind an army of anonymous desires and pleasures.
Something, we feel, should happen; we know not what, yet we
proceed in quest of it. And many of the happiest hours in life fleet by
us in this vain attendance on the genius of the place and moment. It
is thus that tracts of young fir, and low rocks that reach into deep
soundings, particularly delight and torture me. Something must have

happened in such places, and perhaps ages back, to members of my
race; and when I was a child I tried to invent appropriate games for
them, as I still try, just as vainly, to fit them with the proper story.
Some places speak distinctly. Certain dank gardens cry aloud for a
murder; certain old houses demand to be haunted; certain coasts are
set aside for shipwreck. Other spots again seem to abide their
destiny, suggestive and impenetrable, "miching mallecho." The inn
at Burford Bridge, with its arbours and green garden and silent,
eddying river—though it is known already as the place where Keats
wrote some of his _Endymion_ and Nelson parted from his Emma—
still seems to wait the coming of the appropriate legend. Within
these ivied walls, behind these old green shutters, some further
business smoulders, waiting for its hour. The old Hawes Inn at the
Queen's ferry makes a similar call upon my fancy. There it stands,
apart from the town, beside the pier, in a climate of its own, half
inland, half marine—in front, the ferry bubbling with the tide and
the guard-ship swinging to her anchor; behind, the old garden with
the trees. Americans seek it already for the sake of Lovel and
Oldbuck, who dined there at the beginning of the _Antiquary_. But you
need not tell me—that is not all; there is some story, unrecorded or
not yet complete, which must express the meaning of that inn more
fully.... I have lived both at the Hawes and Burford in a perpetual
flutter, on the heel, as it seemed, of some adventure that should
justify the place; but though the feeling had me to bed at night and
called me again at morning in one unbroken round of pleasure and
suspense, nothing befell me in either worth remark. The man or the
hour had not yet come; but some day, I think, a boat shall put off
from the Queen's ferry, fraught with a dear cargo, and some frosty
night a horseman, on a tragic errand, rattle with his whip upon the
green shutters at the inn at Burford.

_FROM "MIDNIGHT IN LONDON"_

Clang! Clang! Clang! the fire-bells! Bing! Bing! Bing! the alarm! In
an instant quiet turns to uproar—an outburst of noise, excitement,
clamor—bedlam broke loose; Bing! Bing! Bing! Rattle, clash and
clatter. Open fly the doors; brave men mount their boxes. Bing!
Bing! Bing! They're off! The horses tear down the street like mad.

Bing! Bing! Bing! goes the gong!

"Get out of the track! The engines are coming! For God's sake,
snatch that child from the road!"

On, on, wildly, resolutely, madly fly the steeds. Bing! Bing! the
gong. Away dash the horses on the wings of fevered fury. On whirls
the machine, down streets, around corners, up this avenue and across
that one, out into the very bowels of darkness, whiffing, wheezing,
shooting a million sparks from the stack, paving the path of startled
night with a galaxy of stars. Over the house-tops to the north, a
volcanic burst of flame shoots out, belching with blinding effect.
The sky is ablaze. A tenement house is burning. Five hundred souls
are in peril. Merciful Heaven! Spare the victims! Are the engines
coming? Yes, here they are, dashing down the street. Look! the
horses ride upon the wind; eyes bulging like balls of fire; nostrils
wide open. A palpitating billow of fire, rolling, plunging, bounding
rising, falling, swelling, heaving, and with mad passion bursting its
red-hot sides asunder, reaching out its arms, encircling, squeezing,
grabbing up, swallowing everything before it with the hot, greedy
mouth of an appalling monster.

How the horses dash around the corner! Animal instinct say you?
Aye, more. Brute reason.

"Up the ladders, men!"

The towering building is buried in bloated banks of savage, biting
elements. Forked tongues dart out and in, dodge here and there, up
and down, and wind their cutting edges around every object. A
crash, a dull, explosive sound, and a puff of smoke leaps out. At the
highest point upon the roof stands a dark figure in a desperate strait,
the hands making frantic gestures, the arms swinging wildly—and
then the body shoots off into frightful space, plunging upon the
pavement with a revolting thud. The man's arm strikes a bystander
as he darts down. The crowd shudders, sways, and utters a low
murmur of pity and horror. The faint-hearted lookers-on hide their
faces. One woman swoons away.

"Poor fellow! Dead!" exclaims a laborer, as he looks upon the man's
body.

"Aye, Joe, and I knew him well, too! He lived next door to me, five
flights back. He leaves a widowed mother and two wee bits of
orphans. I helped him bury his wife a fortnight ago. Ah, Joe! but it's
hard lines for the orphans."

A ghastly hour moves on, dragging its regiment of panic in its trail
and leaving crimson blotches of cruelty along the path of night.

"Are they all out, firemen?"

"Aye, aye, sir!"

"No, they're not! There's a woman in the top window holding a child
in her arms—over yonder in the right-hand corner! The ladders,
there! A hundred pounds to the man who makes the rescue!"

A dozen start. One man more supple than the others, and reckless in
his bravery, clambers to the top rung of the ladder.

"Too short!" he cries. "Hoist another!"

Up it goes. He mounts to the window, fastens the rope, lashes
mother and babe, swings them off into ugly emptiness, and lets them
down to be rescued by his comrades.

"Bravo, fireman!" shouts the crowd.

A crash breaks through the uproar of crackling timbers.

"Look alive, up there! Great God! The roof has fallen!"

The walls sway, rock, and tumble in with a deafening roar. The
spectators cease to breathe. The cold truth reveals itself. The fireman
has been carried into the seething furnace. An old woman, bent with
the weight of age, rushes through the fire line, shrieking, raving, and
wringing her hands and opening her heart of grief.

"Poor John! He was all I had! And a brave lad he was, too! But he's
gone now. He lost his own life in savin' two more, and now—now
he's there, away in there!" she repeats, pointing to the cruel oven.

The engines do their work. The flames die out. An eerie gloom
hangs over the ruins like a formidable, blackened pall.

INFLUENCING BY NARRATION
```

```
The art of narration is the art of writing in hooks and eyes. The
principle consists in making the appropriate thought follow the
appropriate thought, the proper fact the proper fact; in first preparing
the mind for what is to come, and then letting it come.—WALTER
BAGEHOT, Literary Studies.
```

```
Our very speech is curiously historical. Most men, you may observe,
speak only to narrate; not in imparting what they have thought,
```

```
which indeed were often a very small matter, but in exhibiting what
they have undergone or seen, which is a quite unlimited one, do
talkers dilate. Cut us off from Narrative, how would the stream of
conversation, even among the wisest, languish into detached
handfuls, and among the foolish utterly evaporate! Thus, as we do
nothing but enact History, we say little but recite it.—THOMAS
CARLYLE, On History.
```

Only a small segment of the great field of narration offers its resources to the
public speaker, and that includes the anecdote, biographical facts, and the
narration of events in general.

Narration—more easily defined than mastered—is the recital of an incident, or a
group of facts and occurrences, in such a manner as to produce a desired effect.

The laws of narration are few, but its successful practise involves more of art
than would at first appear—so much, indeed, that we cannot even touch upon its
technique here, but must content ourselves with an examination of a few
examples of narration as used in public speech.

In a preliminary way, notice how radically the public speaker's use of narrative
differs from that of the story-writer in the more limited scope, absence of
extended dialogue and character drawing, and freedom from elaboration of
detail, which characterize platform narrative. On the other hand, there are several
similarities of method: the frequent combination of narration with exposition,
description, argumentation, and pleading; the care exercised in the arrangement
of material so as to produce a strong effect at the close (climax); the very general
practise of concealing the "point" (dénouement) of a story until the effective
moment; and the careful suppression of needless, and therefore hurtful, details.

So we see that, whether for magazine or platform, the art of narration involves
far more than the recital of annals; the succession of events recorded requires a
_plan_ in order to bring them out with real effect.

It will be noticed, too, that the literary style in platform narration is likely to be
either less polished and more vigorously dramatic than in that intended for
publication, or else more fervid and elevated in tone. In this latter respect,
however, the best platform speaking of today differs from the models of the
preceding generation, wherein a highly dignified, and sometimes pompous, style
was thought the only fitting dress for a public deliverance. Great, noble and
stirring as these older masters were in their lofty and impassioned eloquence, we

are sometimes oppressed when we read their sounding periods for any great
length of time—even allowing for all that we lose by missing the speaker's
presence, voice, and fire. So let us model our platform narration, as our other
forms of speech, upon the effective addresses of the moderns, without lessening
our admiration for the older school.

_The Anecdote_

An anecdote is a short narrative of a single event, told as being striking enough
to bring out a point. The keener the point, the more condensed the form, and the
more suddenly the application strikes the hearer, the better the story.

To regard an anecdote as an illustration—an interpretive picture—will help to
hold us to its true purpose, for a purposeless story is of all offenses on the
platform the most asinine. A perfectly capital joke will fall flat when it is
dragged in by the nape without evident bearing on the subject under discussion.
On the other hand, an apposite anecdote has saved many a speech from failure.

"There is no finer opportunity for the display of tact than in the introduction of
witty or humorous stories into a discourse. Wit is keen and like a rapier, piercing
deeply, sometimes even to the heart. Humor is good-natured, and does not
wound. Wit is founded upon the sudden discovery of an unsuspected relation
existing between two ideas. Humor deals with things out of relation—with the
incongruous. It was wit in Douglass Jerrold to retort upon the scowl of a stranger
whose shoulder he had familiarly slapped, mistaking him for a friend: 'I beg your
pardon, I thought I knew you—but I'm glad I don't.' It was humor in the
Southern orator, John Wise, to liken the pleasure of spending an evening with a
Puritan girl to that of sitting on a block of ice in winter, cracking hailstones

between his teeth."[[^2][^4]]

The foregoing quotation has been introduced chiefly to illustrate the first and
simplest form of anecdote—the single sentence embodying a pungent saying.

Another simple form is that which conveys its meaning without need of
"application," as the old preachers used to say. George Ade has quoted this one
as the best joke he ever heard:

```
Two solemn-looking gentlemen were riding together in a railway
carriage. One gentleman said to the other: "Is your wife entertaining
this summer?" Whereupon the other gentleman replied: "Not very."
```

Other anecdotes need harnessing to the particular truth the speaker wishes to
carry along in his talk. Sometimes the application is made before the story is told
and the audience is prepared to make the comparison, point by point, as the
illustration is told. Henry W. Grady used this method in one of the anecdotes he
told while delivering his great extemporaneous address, "The New South."

```
Age does not endow all things with strength and virtue, nor are all
new things to be despised. The shoemaker who put over his door,
"John Smith's shop, founded 1760," was more than matched by his
young rival across the street who hung out this sign: "Bill Jones.
Established 1886. No old stock kept in this shop."
```

In two anecdotes, told also in "The New South," Mr. Grady illustrated another
way of enforcing the application: in both instances he split the idea he wished to
drive home, bringing in part before and part after the recital of the story. The fact
that the speaker misquoted the words of Genesis in which the Ark is described
did not seem to detract from the burlesque humor of the story.

```
I bespeak the utmost stretch of your courtesy tonight. I am not
troubled about those from whom I come. You remember the man
whose wife sent him to a neighbor with a pitcher of milk, who,
tripping on the top step, fell, with such casual interruptions as the
landings afforded, into the basement, and, while picking himself up,
had the pleasure of hearing his wife call out:
```

```
"John, did you break the pitcher?
```

```
"No, I didn't," said John, "but I be dinged if I don't."
```

```
So, while those who call to me from behind may inspire me with
energy, if not with courage, I ask an indulgent hearing from you. I
beg that you will bring your full faith in American fairness and
frankness to judgment upon what I shall say. There was an old
preacher once who told some boys of the Bible lesson he was going
to read in the morning. The boys, finding the place, glued together
the connecting pages. The next morning he read on the bottom of
one page: "When Noah was one hundred and twenty years old he
took unto himself a wife, who was"—then turning the page—"one
hundred and forty cubits long, forty cubits wide, built of gopher
wood, and covered with pitch inside and out." He was naturally
puzzled at this. He read it again, verified it, and then said, "My
```

```
friends, this is the first time I ever met this in the Bible, but I accept
it as an evidence of the assertion that we are fearfully and
wonderfully made." If I could get you to hold such faith to-night, I
could proceed cheerfully to the task I otherwise approach with a
sense of consecration.
```

Now and then a speaker will plunge without introduction into an anecdote,
leaving the application to follow. The following illustrates this method:

```
A large, slew-footed darky was leaning against the corner of the
railroad station in a Texas town when the noon whistle in the
canning factory blew and the hands hurried out, bearing their grub
buckets. The darky listened, with his head on one side until the
rocketing echo had quite died away. Then he heaved a deep sigh and
remarked to himself:
```

```
"Dar she go. Dinner time for some folks—but jes' 12 o'clock fur
me!"
```

```
That is the situation in thousands of American factories, large and
small, today. And why? etc., etc.
```

Doubtless the most frequent platform use of the anecdote is in the pulpit. The
sermon "illustration," however, is not always strictly narrative in form, but tends
to extended comparison, as the following from Dr. Alexander Maclaren:

```
Men will stand as Indian fakirs do, with their arms above their heads
until they stiffen there. They will perch themselves upon pillars like
Simeon Stylites, for years, till the birds build their nests in their hair.
They will measure all the distance from Cape Comorin to
Juggernaut's temple with their bodies along the dusty road. They
will wear hair shirts and scourge themselves. They will fast and
deny themselves. They will build cathedrals and endow churches.
They will do as many of you do, labor by fits and starts all thru your
lives at the endless task of making yourselves ready for heaven, and
winning it by obedience and by righteousness. They will do all these
things and do them gladly, rather than listen to the humbling
message that says, "You do not need to do anything—wash." Is it
your washing, or the water, that will clean you? Wash and be clean!
Naaman's cleaning was only a test of his obedience, and a token that
it was God who cleansed him. There was no power in Jordan's
```

```
waters to take away the taint of leprosy. Our cleansing is in that
blood of Jesus Christ that has the power to take away all sin, and to
make the foulest amongst us pure and clean.
```

One final word must be said about the introduction to the anecdote. A clumsy,
inappropriate introduction is fatal, whereas a single apt or witty sentence will
kindle interest and prepare a favorable hearing. The following extreme
illustration, by the English humorist, Captain Harry Graham, well satirizes the
stumbling manner:

```
The best story that I ever heard was one that I was told once in the
fall of 1905 (or it may have been 1906), when I was visiting Boston
—at least, I think it was Boston; it may have been Washington (my
memory is so bad).
```

```
I happened to run across a most amusing man whose name I forget
—Williams or Wilson or Wilkins; some name like that—and he told
me this story while we were waiting for a trolley car.
```

```
I can still remember how heartily I laughed at the time; and again,
that evening, after I had gone to bed, how I laughed myself to sleep
recalling the humor of this incredibly humorous story. It was really
quite extraordinarily funny. In fact, I can truthfully affirm that it is
quite the most amusing story I have ever had the privilege of
hearing. Unfortunately, I've forgotten it.
```

_Biographical Facts_

Public speaking has much to do with personalities; naturally, therefore, the
narration of a series of biographical details, including anecdotes among the
recital of interesting facts, plays a large part in the eulogy, the memorial address,
the political speech, the sermon, the lecture, and other platform deliverances.
Whole addresses may be made up of such biographical details, such as a sermon
on "Moses," or a lecture on "Lee."

The following example is in itself an expanded anecdote, forming a link in a
chain:

```
MARIUS IN PRISON
```

```
The peculiar sublimity of the Roman mind does not express itself,
nor is it at all to be sought, in their poetry. Poetry, according to the
```

```
Roman ideal of it, was not an adequate organ for the grander
movements of the national mind. Roman sublimity must be looked
for in Roman acts, and in Roman sayings. Where, again, will you
find a more adequate expression of the Roman majesty, than in the
saying of Trajan—Imperatorem oportere stantem mori—that Cæsar
ought to die standing; a speech of imperatorial grandeur! Implying
that he, who was "the foremost man of all this world,"—and, in
regard to all other nations, the representative of his own,—should
express its characteristic virtue in his farewell act—should die in
procinctu—and should meet the last enemy as the first, with a
Roman countenance and in a soldier's attitude. If this had an
imperatorial—what follows had a consular majesty, and is almost
the grandest story upon record.
```

```
Marius, the man who rose to be seven times consul, was in a
dungeon, and a slave was sent in with commission to put him to
death. These were the persons,—the two extremities of exalted and
forlorn humanity, its vanward and its rearward man, a Roman consul
and an abject slave. But their natural relations to each other were, by
the caprice of fortune, monstrously inverted: the consul was in
chains; the slave was for a moment the arbiter of his fate. By what
spells, what magic, did Marius reinstate himself in his natural
prerogatives? By what marvels drawn from heaven or from earth,
did he, in the twinkling of an eye, again invest himself with the
purple, and place between himself and his assassin a host of
shadowy lictors? By the mere blank supremacy of great minds over
weak ones. He fascinated the slave, as a rattlesnake does a bird.
Standing "like Teneriffe," he smote him with his eye, and said,
"Tune, homo, audes occidere C. Marium?"—"Dost thou, fellow,
presume to kill Caius Marius?" Whereat, the reptile, quaking under
the voice, nor daring to affront the consular eye, sank gently to the
ground—turned round upon his hands and feet—and, crawling out
of the prison like any other vermin, left Marius standing in solitude
as steadfast and immovable as the capitol.
```

```
—THOMAS DE QUINCY.
```

Here is a similar example, prefaced by a general historical statement and
concluding with autobiographical details:

_A REMINISCENCE OF LEXINGTON_

One raw morning in spring—it will be eighty years the [^1]:[^9]:th day of
this month—Hancock and Adams, the Moses and Aaron of that
Great Deliverance, were both at Lexington; they also had
"obstructed an officer" with brave words. British soldiers, a
thousand strong, came to seize them and carry them over sea for
trial, and so nip the bud of Freedom auspiciously opening in that
early spring. The town militia came together before daylight, "for
training." A great, tall man, with a large head and a high, wide brow,
their captain,—one who had "seen service,"—marshalled them into
line, numbering but seventy, and bade "every man load his piece
with powder and ball. I will order the first man shot that runs away,"
said he, when some faltered. "Don't fire unless fired upon, but if they
want to have a war, let it begin here."

Gentlemen, you know what followed; those farmers and mechanics
"fired the shot heard round the world." A little monument covers the
bones of such as before had pledged their fortune and their sacred
honor to the Freedom of America, and that day gave it also their
lives. I was born in that little town, and bred up amid the memories
of that day. When a boy, my mother lifted me up, one Sunday, in her
religious, patriotic arms, and held me while I read the first
monumental line I ever saw—"Sacred to Liberty and the Rights of
Mankind."

Since then I have studied the memorial marbles of Greece and
Rome, in many an ancient town; nay, on Egyptian obelisks have read
what was written before the Eternal raised up Moses to lead Israel
out of Egypt; but no chiseled stone has ever stirred me to such
emotion as these rustic names of men who fell "In the Sacred Cause
of God and their Country."

Gentlemen, the Spirit of Liberty, the Love of Justice, were early
fanned into a flame in my boyish heart. That monument covers the
bones of my own kinsfolk; it was their blood which reddened the
long, green grass at Lexington. It was my own name which stands
chiseled on that stone; the tall captain who marshalled his fellow
farmers and mechanics into stern array, and spoke such brave and
dangerous words as opened the war of American Independence,—

```
the last to leave the field,—was my father's father. I learned to read
out of his Bible, and with a musket he that day captured from the
foe, I learned another religious lesson, that "Rebellion to Tyrants is
Obedience to God." I keep them both "Sacred to Liberty and the
Rights of Mankind," to use them both "In the Sacred Cause of God
and my Country."—THEODORE PARKER.
```

_Narration of Events in General_

In this wider, emancipated narration we find much mingling of other forms of
discourse, greatly to the advantage of the speech, for this truth cannot be too
strongly emphasized: The efficient speaker cuts loose from form for the sake of a
big, free effect. The present analyses are for no other purpose than to _acquaint_
you with form—do not allow any such models to hang as a weight about your
neck.

The following pure narration of events, from George William Curtis's "Paul
Revere's Ride," varies the biographical recital in other parts of his famous
oration:

```
That evening, at ten o'clock, eight hundred British troops, under
Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, took boat at the foot of the Common and
crossed to the Cambridge shore. Gage thought his secret had been
kept, but Lord Percy, who had heard the people say on the Common
that the troops would miss their aim, undeceived him. Gage instantly
ordered that no one should leave the town. But as the troops crossed
the river, Ebenezer Dorr, with a message to Hancock and Adams,
was riding over the Neck to Roxbury, and Paul Revere was rowing
over the river to Charlestown, having agreed with his friend, Robert
Newman, to show lanterns from the belfry of the Old North Church
—"One if by land, and two if by sea"—as a signal of the march of
the British.
```

The following, from the same oration, beautifully mingles description with
narration:

```
It was a brilliant night. The winter had been unusually mild, and the
spring very forward. The hills were already green. The early grain
waved in the fields, and the air was sweet with the blossoming
orchards. Already the robins whistled, the bluebirds sang, and the
benediction of peace rested upon the landscape. Under the cloudless
```

```
moon the soldiers silently marched, and Paul Revere swiftly rode,
galloping through Medford and West Cambridge, rousing every
house as he went spurring for Lexington and Hancock and Adams,
and evading the British patrols who had been sent out to stop the
news.
```

In the succeeding extract from another of Mr. Curtis's addresses, we have a free
use of allegory as illustration:

```
THE LEADERSHIP OF EDUCATED MEN
```

```
There is a modern English picture which the genius of Hawthorne
might have inspired. The painter calls it, "How they met
themselves." A man and a woman, haggard and weary, wandering
lost in a somber wood, suddenly meet the shadowy figures of a
youth and a maid. Some mysterious fascination fixes the gaze and
stills the hearts of the wanderers, and their amazement deepens into
awe as they gradually recognize themselves as once they were; the
soft bloom of youth upon their rounded cheeks, the dewy light of
hope in their trusting eyes, exulting confidence in their springing
step, themselves blithe and radiant with the glory of the dawn.
Today, and here, we meet ourselves. Not to these familiar scenes
alone—yonder college-green with its reverend traditions; the
halcyon cove of the Seekonk, upon which the memory of Roger
Williams broods like a bird of calm; the historic bay, beating forever
with the muffled oars of Barton and of Abraham Whipple; here, the
humming city of the living; there, the peaceful city of the dead;—not
to these only or chiefly do we return, but to ourselves as we once
were. It is not the smiling freshmen of the year, it is your own
beardless and unwrinkled faces, that are looking from the windows
of University Hall and of Hope College. Under the trees upon the
hill it is yourselves whom you see walking, full of hopes and
dreams, glowing with conscious power, and "nourishing a youth
sublime;" and in this familiar temple, which surely has never echoed
with eloquence so fervid and inspiring as that of your
commencement orations, it is not yonder youths in the galleries who,
as they fondly believe, are whispering to yonder maids; it is your
younger selves who, in the days that are no more, are murmuring to
the fairest mothers and grandmothers of those maids.
```

```
Happy the worn and weary man and woman in the picture could
they have felt their older eyes still glistening with that earlier light,
and their hearts yet beating with undiminished sympathy and
aspiration. Happy we, brethren, whatever may have been achieved,
whatever left undone, if, returning to the home of our earlier years,
we bring with us the illimitable hope, the unchilled resolution, the
inextinguishable faith of youth.
```

CHAPTER XXII

```
INFLUENCING BY SUGGESTION
```

```
Sometimes the feeling that a given way of looking at things is
undoubtedly correct prevents the mind from thinking at all.... In
view of the hindrances which certain kinds or degrees of feeling
throw into the way of thinking, it might be inferred that the thinker
must suppress the element of feeling in the inner life. No greater
mistake could be made. If the Creator endowed man with the power
to think, to feel, and to will, these several activities of the mind are
not designed to be in conflict, and so long as any one of them is not
perverted or allowed to run to excess, it necessarily aids and
strengthens the others in their normal functions.
```

```
—NATHAN C. SCHAEFFER, Thinking and Learning to Think.
```

When we weigh, compare, and decide upon the value of any given ideas, we
reason; when an idea produces in us an opinion or an action, without first being
subjected to deliberation, we are moved by suggestion.

Man was formerly thought to be a reasoning animal, basing his actions on the
conclusions of natural logic. It was supposed that before forming an opinion or
deciding on a course of conduct he weighed at least some of the reasons for and
against the matter, and performed a more or less simple process of reasoning.
But modern research has shown that quite the opposite is true. Most of our
opinions and actions are not based upon conscious reasoning, but are the result
of suggestion. In fact, some authorities declare that an act of pure reasoning is
very rare in the average mind. Momentous decisions are made, far-reaching
actions are determined upon, primarily by the force of suggestion.

Notice that word "primarily," for simple thought, and even mature reasoning,
often follows a suggestion accepted in the mind, and the thinker fondly supposes
that his conclusion is from first to last based on cold logic.

_The Basis of Suggestion_

We must think of suggestion both as an effect and as a cause. Considered as an
effect, or objectively, there must be something in the hearer that predisposes him
to receive suggestion; considered as a cause, or subjectively, there must be some
methods by which the speaker can move upon that particularly susceptible
attitude of the hearer. How to do this honestly and fairly is our problem—to do it
dishonestly and trickily, to use suggestion to bring about conviction and action
without a basis of right and truth and in a bad cause, is to assume the terrible
responsibility that must fall on the champion of error. Jesus scorned not to use
suggestion so that he might move men to their benefit, but every vicious trickster
has adopted the same means to reach base ends. Therefore honest men will
examine well into their motives and into the truth of their cause, before seeking
to influence men by suggestion.

Three fundamental conditions make us all susceptive to suggestion:

_We naturally respect authority._ In every mind this is only a question of degree,
ranging from the subject who is easily hypnotized to the stubborn mind that
fortifies itself the more strongly with every assault upon its opinion. The latter
type is almost immune to suggestion.

One of the singular things about suggestion is that it is rarely a fixed quantity.
The mind that is receptive to the authority of a certain person may prove
inflexible to another; moods and environments that produce hypnosis readily in
one instance may be entirely inoperative in another; and some minds can
scarcely ever be thus moved. We do know, however, that the feeling of the
subject that authority—influence, power, domination, control, whatever you
wish to call it—lies in the person of the suggester, is the basis of all suggestion.

The extreme force of this influence is demonstrated in hypnotism. The hypnotic
subject is told that he is in the water; he accepts the statement as true and makes
swimming motions. He is told that a band is marching down the street, playing
"The Star Spangled Banner;" he declares he hears the music, arises and stands
with head bared.

In the same way some speakers are able to achieve a modified hypnotic effect

upon their audiences. The hearers will applaud measures and ideas which, after
individual reflection, they will repudiate unless such reflection brings the
conviction that the first impression is correct.

A second important principle is that _our feelings, thoughts and wills tend to_
_follow the line of least resistance_. Once open the mind to the sway of one feeling
and it requires a greater power of feeling, thought, or will—or even all three—to
unseat it. Our feelings influence our judgments and volitions much more than we
care to admit. So true is this that it is a superhuman task to get an audience to
reason fairly on a subject on which it feels deeply, and when this result is
accomplished the success becomes noteworthy, as in the case of Henry Ward
Beecher's Liverpool speech. Emotional ideas once accepted are soon cherished,
and finally become our very inmost selves. Attitudes based on feelings alone are
prejudices.

What is true of our feelings, in this respect, applies to our ideas: All thoughts
that enter the mind tend to be accepted as truth unless a stronger and
contradictory thought arises.

The speaker skilled in moving men to action manages to dominate the minds of
his audience with his thoughts by subtly prohibiting the entertaining of ideas
hostile to his own. Most of us are captured by the latest strong attack, and if we
can be induced to act while under the stress of that last insistent thought, we lose
sight of counter influences. The fact is that almost all our decisions—if they
involve thought at all—are of this sort: At the moment of decision the course of
action then under contemplation usurps the attention, and conflicting ideas are
dropped out of consideration.

The head of a large publishing house remarked only recently that ninety per cent
of the people who bought books by subscription never read them. They buy
because the salesman presents his wares so skillfully that every consideration but
the attractiveness of the book drops out of the mind, and that thought prompts
action. _Every_ idea that enters the mind will result in action unless a contradictory
thought arises to prohibit it. Think of singing the musical scale and it will result
in your singing it unless the counter-thought of its futility or absurdity inhibits
your action. If you bandage and "doctor" a horse's foot, he will go lame. You
cannot think of swallowing, without the muscles used in that process being
affected. You cannot think of saying "hello," without a slight movement of the
muscles of speech. To warn children that they should not put beans up their
noses is the surest method of getting them to do it. Every thought called up in the

mind of your audience will work either for or against you. Thoughts are not dead
matter; they radiate dynamic energy—the thoughts all tend to pass into action.
"Thought is another name for fate." Dominate your hearers' thoughts, allay all
contradictory ideas, and you will sway them as you wish.

Volitions as well as feelings and thoughts tend to follow the line of least
resistance. That is what makes habit. Suggest to a man that it is impossible to
change his mind and in most cases it becomes more difficult to do so—the
exception is the man who naturally jumps to the contrary. Counter suggestion is
the only way to reach him. Suggest subtly and persistently that the opinions of
those in the audience who are opposed to your views are changing, and it
requires an effort of the will—in fact, a summoning of the forces of feeling,
thought and will—to stem the tide of change that has subconsciously set in.

But, not only are we moved by authority, and tend toward channels of least
resistance: _We are all influenced by our environments_. It is difficult to rise above
the sway of a crowd—its enthusiasms and its fears are contagious because they
are suggestive. What so many feel, we say to ourselves, must have some basis in
truth. Ten times ten makes more than one hundred. Set ten men to speaking to
ten audiences of ten men each, and compare the aggregate power of those ten
speakers with that of one man addressing one hundred men. The ten speakers
may be more logically convincing than the single orator, but the chances are
strongly in favor of the one man's reaching a greater total effect, for the hundred
men will radiate conviction and resolution as ten small groups could not. We all
know the truism about the enthusiasm of numbers. (See the chapter on
"Influencing the Crowd.")

Environment controls us unless the contrary is strongly suggested. A gloomy
day, in a drab room, sparsely tenanted by listeners, invites platform disaster.
Everyone feels it in the air. But let the speaker walk squarely up to the issue and
suggest by all his feeling, manner and words that this is going to be a great
gathering in every vital sense, and see how the suggestive power of environment
recedes before the advance of a more potent suggestion—if such the speaker is
able to make it.

Now these three factors—respect for authority, tendency to follow lines of least
resistance, and susceptibility to environment—all help to bring the auditor into a
state of mind favorable to suggestive influences, but they also react on the
speaker, and now we must consider those personally causative, or subjective,
forces which enable him to use suggestion effectively.

_How the Speaker Can Make Suggestion Effective_

We have seen that under the influence of authoritative suggestion the audience is
inclined to accept the speaker's assertion without argument and criticism. But the
audience is not in this state of mind unless it has implicit confidence in the
speaker. If they lack faith in him, question his motives or knowledge, or even
object to his manner they will not be moved by his most logical conclusion and
will fail to give him a just hearing. _It is all a matter of their confidence in him._
Whether the speaker finds it already in the warm, expectant look of his hearers,
or must win to it against opposition or coldness, he must gain that one great
vantage point before his suggestions take on power in the hearts of his listeners.
Confidence is the mother of Conviction.

Note in the opening of Henry W. Grady's after-dinner speech how he attempted
to secure the confidence of his audience. He created a receptive atmosphere by a
humorous story; expressed his desire to speak with earnestness and sincerity;
acknowledged "the vast interests involved;" deprecated his "untried arm," and
professed his humility. Would not such an introduction give you confidence in
the speaker, unless you were strongly opposed to him? And even then, would it
not partly disarm your antagonism?

```
Mr. President:—Bidden by your invitation to a discussion of the race
problem—forbidden by occasion to make a political speech—I
appreciate, in trying to reconcile orders with propriety, the perplexity
of the little maid, who, bidden to learn to swim, was yet adjured,
"Now, go, my darling; hang your clothes on a hickory limb, and
don't go near the water."
```

```
The stoutest apostle of the Church, they say, is the missionary, and
the missionary, wherever he unfurls his flag, will never find himself
in deeper need of unction and address than I, bidden tonight to plant
the standard of a Southern Democrat in Boston's banquet hall, and to
discuss the problem of the races in the home of Phillips and of
Sumner. But, Mr. President, if a purpose to speak in perfect
frankness and sincerity; if earnest understanding of the vast interests
involved; if a consecrating sense of what disaster may follow further
misunderstanding and estrangement; if these may be counted to
steady undisciplined speech and to strengthen an untried arm—then,
sir, I shall find the courage to proceed.
```

Note also Mr. Bryan's attempt to secure the confidence of his audience in the
following introduction to his "Cross of Gold" speech delivered before the
National Democratic Convention in Chicago, [^1]:[^8]:[^9]:[^6]:. He asserts his own inability
to oppose the "distinguished gentleman;" he maintains the holiness of his cause;
and he declares that he will speak in the interest of humanity—well knowing that
humanity is likely to have confidence in the champion of their rights. This
introduction completely dominated the audience, and the speech made Mr. Bryan
famous.

```
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Convention: I would be
presumptuous indeed to present myself against the distinguished
gentlemen to whom you have listened if this were a mere measuring
of abilities; but this is not a contest between persons. The humblest
citizen in all the land, when clad in the armor of a righteous cause, is
stronger than all the hosts of error. I come to speak to you in defense
of a cause as holy as the cause of liberty—the cause of humanity.
```

Some speakers are able to beget confidence by their very manner, while others
can not.

_To secure confidence, be confident._ How can you expect others to accept a
message in which you lack, or seem to lack, faith yourself? Confidence is as
contagious as disease. Napoleon rebuked an officer for using the word
"impossible" in his presence. The speaker who will entertain no idea of defeat
begets in his hearers the idea of his victory. Lady Macbeth was so confident of
success that Macbeth changed his mind about undertaking the assassination.
Columbus was so certain in his mission that Queen Isabella pawned her jewels
to finance his expedition. Assert your message with implicit assurance, and your
own belief will act as so much gunpowder to drive it home.

Advertisers have long utilized this principle. "The machine you will eventually
buy," "Ask the man who owns one," "Has the strength of Gibraltar," are publicity
slogans so full of confidence that they give birth to confidence in the mind of the
reader.

It should—but may not!—go without saying that confidence must have a solid
ground of merit or there will be a ridiculous crash. It is all very well for the
"spellbinder" to claim all the precincts—the official count is just ahead. The
reaction against over-confidence and over-suggestion ought to warn those whose
chief asset is mere bluff.

A short time ago a speaker arose in a public-speaking club and asserted that
grass would spring from wood-ashes sprinkled over the soil, without the aid of
seed. This idea was greeted with a laugh, but the speaker was so sure of his
position that he reiterated the statement forcefully several times and cited his
own personal experience as proof. One of the most intelligent men in the
audience, who at first had derided the idea, at length came to believe in it. When
asked the reason for his sudden change of attitude, he replied: "Because the
speaker is so confident." In fact, he was so confident that it took a letter from the
U.S. Department of Agriculture to dislodge his error.

If by a speaker's confidence, intelligent men can be made to believe such
preposterous theories as this where will the power of self-reliance cease when
plausible propositions are under consideration, advanced with all the power of
convincing speech?

Note the utter assurance in these selections:

```
I know not what course others may take, but as for me give me
liberty or give me death.—PATRICK HENRY.
```

```

your slave;
But I'll swim the sea of slaughter, till I sink
beneath its wave.

```

Under the bludgeonings of chance

How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate;

```

_Authority is a factor in suggestion._ We generally accept as truth, and without
criticism, the words of an authority. When he speaks, contradictory ideas rarely
arise in the mind to inhibit the action he suggests. A judge of the Supreme Court
has the power of his words multiplied by the virtue of his position. The ideas of
the U.S. Commissioner of Immigration on his subject are much more effective
and powerful than those of a soap manufacturer, though the latter may be an able
economist.

This principle also has been used in advertising. We are told that the physicians
to two Kings have recommended Sanatogen. We are informed that the largest
bank in America, Tiffany and Co., and The State, War, and Navy Departments,
all use the Encyclopedia Britannica. The shrewd promoter gives stock in his
company to influential bankers or business men in the community in order that
he may use their examples as a selling argument.

If you wish to influence your audience through suggestion, if you would have
your statements accepted without criticism or argument, you should appear in
the light of an authority—and _be_ one. Ignorance and credulity will remain
unchanged unless the suggestion of authority be followed promptly by facts.
Don't claim authority unless you carry your license in your pocket. Let reason
support the position that suggestion has assumed.

Advertising will help to establish your reputation—it is "up to you" to maintain
it. One speaker found that his reputation as a magazine writer was a splendid

asset as a speaker. Mr. Bryan's publicity, gained by three nominations for the
presidency and his position as Secretary of State, helps him to command large
sums as a speaker. But—back of it all, he _is_ a great speaker. Newspaper
announcements, all kinds of advertising, formality, impressive introductions, all
have a capital effect on the attitude of the audience. But how ridiculous are all
these if a toy pistol is advertised as a sixteen-inch gun!

Note how authority is used in the following to support the strength of the
speaker's appeal:

```
Professor Alfred Russell Wallace has just celebrated his 90th
birthday. Sharing with Charles Darwin the honor of discovering
evolution, Professor Wallace has lately received many and signal
honors from scientific societies. At the dinner given him in London
his address was largely made up of reminiscences. He reviewed the
progress of civilization during the last century and made a series of
brilliant and startling contrasts between the England of 1813 and the
world of 1913. He affirmed that our progress is only seeming and
not real. Professor Wallace insists that the painters, the sculptors, the
architects of Athens and Rome were so superior to the modern men
that the very fragments of their marbles and temples are the despair
of the present day artists. He tells us that man has improved his
telescope and spectacles, but that he is losing his eyesight; that man
is improving his looms, but stiffening his fingers; improving his
automobile and his locomotive, but losing his legs; improving his
foods, but losing his digestion. He adds that the modern white slave
traffic, orphan asylums, and tenement house life in factory towns,
make a black page in the history of the twentieth century.
```

```
Professor Wallace's views are reinforced by the report of the
commission of Parliament on the causes of the deterioration of the
factory-class people. In our own country Professor Jordan warns us
against war, intemperance, overworking, underfeeding of poor
children, and disturbs our contentment with his "Harvest of Blood."
Professor Jenks is more pessimistic. He thinks that the pace, the
climate, and the stress of city life, have broken down the Puritan
stock, that in another century our old families will be extinct, and
that the flood of immigration means a Niagara of muddy waters
fouling the pure springs of American life. In his address in New
Haven Professor Kellogg calls the roll of the signs of race
```

```
degeneracy and tells us that this deterioration even indicates a trend
toward race extinction.
```

```
—NEWELL DWIGHT HILLIS.
```

```
From every side come warnings to the American people. Our
medical journals are filled with danger signals; new books and
magazines, fresh from the press, tell us plainly that our people are
fronting a social crisis. Mr. Jefferson, who was once regarded as
good Democratic authority, seems to have differed in opinion from
the gentleman who has addressed us on the part of the minority.
Those who are opposed to this proposition tell us that the issue of
paper money is a function of the bank, and that the government
ought to go out of the banking business. I stand with Jefferson rather
than with them, and tell them, as he did, that the issue of money is a
function of government, and that the banks ought to go out of the
governing business.
```

```
—WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN.
```

Authority is the great weapon against doubt, but even its force can rarely prevail
against prejudice and persistent wrong-headedness. If any speaker has been able
to forge a sword that is warranted to piece such armor, let him bless humanity by
sharing his secret with his platform brethren everywhere, for thus far he is alone
in his glory.

There is a middle-ground between the suggestion of authority and the confession
of weakness that offers a wide range for tact in the speaker. No one can advise
you when to throw your "hat in the ring" and say defiantly at the outstart,
"Gentlemen, I am here to fight!" Theodore Roosevelt can do that—Beecher
would have been mobbed if he had begun in that style at Liverpool. It is for your
own tact to decide whether you will use the disarming grace of Henry W.
Grady's introduction just quoted (even the time-worn joke was ingenuous and
seemed to say, "Gentlemen, I come to you with no carefully-palmed coins"), or
whether the solemn gravity of Mr. Bryan before the Convention will prove to be
more effective. Only be sure that your opening attitude is well thought out, and if
it change as you warm up to your subject, let not the change lay you open to a
revulsion of feeling in your audience.

_Example is a powerful means of suggestion._ As we saw while thinking of
environment in its effects on an audience, we do, without the usual amount of

hesitation and criticism, what others are doing. Paris wears certain hats and
gowns; the rest of the world imitates. The child mimics the actions, accents and
intonations of the parent. Were a child never to hear anyone speak, he would
never acquire the power of speech, unless under most arduous training, and even
then only imperfectly. One of the biggest department stores in the United States
spends fortunes on one advertising slogan: "Everybody is going to the big store."
That makes everybody want to go.

You can reinforce the power of your message by showing that it has been widely
accepted. Political organizations subsidize applause to create the impression that
their speakers' ideas are warmly received and approved by the audience. The
advocates of the commission-form of government of cities, the champions of
votes for women, reserve as their strongest arguments the fact that a number of
cities and states have already successfully accepted their plans. Advertisements
use the testimonial for its power of suggestion.

Observe how this principle has been applied in the following selections, and
utilize it on every occasion possible in your attempts to influence through
suggestion:

```
The war is actually begun. The next gale that sweeps from the North
will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms. Our brethren are
already in the field. Why stand ye here idle?
```

```
—PATRICK HENRY.
```

```
With a zeal approaching the zeal which inspired the Crusaders who
followed Peter the Hermit, our silver Democrats went forth from
victory unto victory until they are now assembled, not to discuss, not
to debate, but to enter up the judgment already rendered by the plain
people of this country. In this contest brother has been arrayed
against brother, father against son. The warmest ties of love,
acquaintance, and association have been disregarded; old leaders
have been cast aside when they refused to give expression to the
sentiments of those whom they would lead, and new leaders have
sprung up to give direction to this cause of truth. Thus has the
contest been waged, and we have assembled here under as binding
and solemn instructions as were ever imposed upon representatives
of the people.
```

```
—WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN.
```

_Figurative and indirect language has suggestive force_, because it does not make
statements that can be directly disputed. It arouses no contradictory ideas in the
minds of the audience, thereby fulfilling one of the basic requisites of
suggestion. By _implying_ a conclusion in indirect or figurative language it is often
asserted most forcefully.

Note that in the following Mr. Bryan did not say that Mr. McKinley would be
defeated. He implied it in a much more effective manner:

```
Mr. McKinley was nominated at St. Louis upon a platform which
declared for the maintenance of the gold standard until it can be
changed into bimetallism by international agreement. Mr. McKinley
was the most popular man among the Republicans, and three months
ago everybody in the Republican party prophesied his election. How
is it today? Why, the man who was once pleased to think that he
looked like Napoleon—that man shudders today when he
remembers that he was nominated on the anniversary of the battle of
Waterloo. Not only that, but as he listens he can hear with ever-
increasing distinctness the sound of the waves as they beat upon the
lonely shores of St. Helena.
```

Had Thomas Carlyle said: "A false man cannot found a religion," his words
would have been neither so suggestive nor so powerful, nor so long remembered
as his implication in these striking words:

```
A false man found a religion? Why, a false man cannot build a brick
house! If he does not know and follow truly the properties of mortar,
burnt clay, and what else he works in, it is no house that he makes,
but a rubbish heap. It will not stand for twelve centuries, to lodge a
hundred and eighty millions; it will fall straightway. A man must
conform himself to Nature's laws, be verily in communion with
Nature and the truth of things, or Nature will answer him, No, not at
all!
```

Observe how the picture that Webster draws here is much more emphatic and
forceful than any mere assertion could be:

```
Sir, I know not how others may feel, but as for myself when I see
my alma mater surrounded, like Caesar in the senate house, by those
who are reiterating stab after stab, I would not for this right hand
have her turn to me and say, "And thou, too, my son!"—WEBSTER.
```

A speech should be built on sound logical foundations, and no man should dare
to speak in behalf of a fallacy. Arguing a subject, however, will necessarily
arouse contradictory ideas in the mind of your audience. When immediate action
or persuasion is desired, suggestion is more efficacious than argument—when
both are judiciously mixed, the effect is irresistible.

CHAPTER XXIII

```
INFLUENCING BY ARGUMENT
```

```
Common sense is the common sense of mankind. It is the product of
common observation and experience. It is modest, plain, and
unsophisticated. It sees with everybody's eyes, and hears with
everybody's ears. It has no capricious distinctions, no perplexities,
and no mysteries. It never equivocates, and never trifles. Its
language is always intelligible. It is known by clearness of speech
and singleness of purpose.
```

```
—GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE, Public Speaking and Debate.
```

The very name of logic is awesome to most young speakers, but so soon as they
come to realize that its processes, even when most intricate, are merely technical
statements of the truths enforced by common sense, it will lose its terrors. In

fact, logic[[^2][^5]] is a fascinating subject, well worth the public speaker's study, for it
explains the principles that govern the use of argument and proof.

Argumentation is the process of producing conviction by means of reasoning.
Other ways of producing conviction there are, notably suggestion, as we have
just shown, but no means is so high, so worthy of respect, as the adducing of
sound reasons in support of a contention.

Since more than one side of a subject must be considered before we can claim to
have deliberated upon it fairly, we ought to think of argumentation under two
aspects: building up an argument, and tearing down an argument; that is, you
must not only examine into the stability of your structure of argument so that it
may both support the proposition you intend to probe and yet be so sound that it
cannot be overthrown by opponents, but you must also be so keen to detect
defects in argument that you will be able to demolish the weaker arguments of
those who argue against you.

We can consider argumentation only generally, leaving minute and technical
discussions to such excellent works as George P. Baker's "The Principles of
Argumentation," and George Jacob Holyoake's "Public Speaking and Debate."
Any good college rhetoric also will give help on the subject, especially the
works of John Franklin Genung and Adams Sherman Hill. The student is urged
to familiarize himself with at least one of these texts.

The following series of questions will, it is hoped, serve a triple purpose: that of

suggesting the forms of proof together with the ways in which they may be used;
that of helping the speaker to test the strength of his arguments; and that of
enabling the speaker to attack his opponent's arguments with both keenness and
justice.

TESTING AN ARGUMENT

I. THE QUESTION UNDER DISCUSSION

does not follow? (A _non sequitur_.)

(_c_) Can your syllogism be reduced to an absurdity?
(_Reductio ad absurdum._)

```
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES
```

[^1]:. Show why an unsupported assertion is not an argument.

[^2]:. Illustrate how an irrelevant fact may be made to seem to support an argument.

[^3]:. What inferences may justly be made from the following?

```
During the Boer War it was found that the average Englishman did
not measure up to the standards of recruiting and the average soldier
in the field manifested a low plane of vitality and endurance.
Parliament, alarmed by the disastrous consequences, instituted an
investigation. The commission appointed brought in a finding that
alcoholic poisoning was the great cause of the national degeneracy.
The investigations of the commission have been supplemented by
investigations of scientific bodies and individual scientists, all
arriving at the same conclusion. As a consequence, the British
Government has placarded the streets of a hundred cities with
billboards setting forth the destructive and degenerating nature of
alcohol and appealing to the people in the name of the nation to
desist from drinking alcoholic beverages. Under efforts directed by
the Government the British Army is fast becoming an army of total
abstainers.
```

```
The Governments of continental Europe followed the lead of the
British Government. The French Government has placarded France
with appeals to the people, attributing the decline of the birth rate
and increase in the death rate to the widespread use of alcoholic
beverages. The experience of the German Government has been the
same. The German Emperor has clearly stated that leadership in war
and in peace will be held by the nation that roots out alcohol. He has
undertaken to eliminate even the drinking of beer, so far as possible,
from the German Army and Navy.—RICHMOND PEARSON HOBSON,
Before the U.S. Congress.
```

[^4]:. Since the burden of proof lies on him who attacks a position, or argues for a
change in affairs, how would his opponent be likely to conduct his own part of a
debate?

[^5]:. Define (_a_) syllogism; (_b_) rebuttal; (_c_) "begging the question;" (_d_) premise; (_e_)
rejoinder; (_f_) sur-rejoinder; (_g_) dilemma; (_h_) induction; (_i_) deduction; (_j_) _a priori_;
(_k_) _a posteriori_; (_l_) inference.

[^6]:. Criticise this reasoning:

```
Men ought not to smoke tobacco, because to do so is contrary to best
medical opinion. My physician has expressly condemned the
practise, and is a medical authority in this country.
```

[^7]:. Criticise this reasoning:

```
Men ought not to swear profanely, because it is wrong. It is wrong
for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral Law, and it is contrary
to the Moral Law because it is contrary to the Scriptures. It is
contrary to the Scriptures because it is contrary to the will of God,
and we know it is contrary to God's will because it is wrong.
```

[^8]:. Criticise this syllogism:

```
MAJOR PREMISE: All men who have no cares are happy.
MINOR PREMISE: Slovenly men are careless.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, slovenly men are happy.
```

[^9]:. Criticise the following major, or foundation, premises:

```
All is not gold that glitters.
```

```
All cold may be expelled by fire.
```

[^1]:[^0]:. Criticise the following fallacy (_non sequitur_):

```
MAJOR PREMISE: All strong men admire strength.
MINOR PREMISE: This man is not strong.
CONCLUSION: Therefore this man does not admire strength.
```

[^1]:[^1]:. Criticise these statements:

```
Sleep is beneficial on account of its soporific qualities.
```

```
Fiske's histories are authentic because they contain accurate
accounts of American history, and we know that they are true
accounts for otherwise they would not be contained in these
authentic works.
```

[^1]:[^2]:. What do you understand from the terms "reasoning from effect to cause" and
"from cause to effect?" Give examples.

[^1]:[^3]:. What principle did Richmond Pearson Hobson employ in the following?

```
What is the police power of the States? The police power of the
Federal Government or the State—any sovereign State—has been
defined. Take the definition given by Blackstone, which is:
```

The due regulation and domestic order of the Kingdom, whereby the

Judge Cooley says of the liquor traffic:
```

```
The business of manufacturing and selling liquor is one that affects
the public interests in many ways and leads to many disorders. It has
a tendency to increase pauperism and crime. It renders a large force
of peace officers essential, and it adds to the expense of the courts
and of nearly all branches of civil administration.

Justice Bradley, of the United States Supreme Court, says:
```

```
Licenses may be properly required in the pursuit of many
```

```
professions and avocations, which require peculiar skill and training
or supervision for the public welfare. The profession or avocation is
open to all alike who will prepare themselves with the requisite
qualifications or give the requisite security for preserving public
order. This is in harmony with the general proposition that the
ordinary pursuits of life, forming the greater per cent of the
industrial pursuits, are and ought to be free and open to all, subject
only to such general regulations, applying equally to all, as the
general good may demand.
```

```
All such regulations are entirely competent for the legislature to
make and are in no sense an abridgment of the equal rights of
citizens. But a license to do that which is odious and against
common right is necessarily an outrage upon the equal rights of
citizens.

which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not
much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?

DEBATE

RESOLVED: _That armed intervention is not justifiable on the part of any nation to_
_collect, on behalf of private individuals, financial claims against any American_

_nation._[[^2][^7]]

BRIEF OF AFFIRMATIVE ARGUMENT

```
First speaker—Chafee
```

Armed intervention for collection of private claims from any American
nation is not justifiable, for

```
1. It is wrong in principle, because
```

(_a_) It violates the fundamental principles of international law for a
very slight cause

```
(b) It is contrary to the proper function of the State, and
```

```
(c) It is contrary to justice, since claims are exaggerated.
```

```
Second speaker—Hurley
```

```
2. It is disastrous in its results, because
```

```
(a) It incurs danger of grave international complications
```

(_b_) It tends to increase the burden of debt in the South American
republics

```
(c) It encourages a waste of the world's capital, and
```

```
(d) It disturbs peace and stability in South America.
```

```
Third speaker—Bruce
```

```
3. It is unnecessary to collect in this way, because
```

```
(a) Peaceful methods have succeeded
```

(_b_) If these should fail, claims should be settled by The Hague
Tribunal

(_c_) The fault has always been with European States when force has been
used, and

(_d_) In any case, force should not be used, for it counteracts the
movement towards peace.

BRIEF OF NEGATIVE ARGUMENT

```
First speaker—Branch
```

Armed intervention for the collection of private financial claims
against some American States is justifiable, for

[^1]:. _When other means of collection have failed, armed intervention_
_against any nation is essentially proper_, because

```
(a) Justice should always be secured
```

```
(b) Non-enforcement of payment puts a premium on dishonesty
```

(_c_) Intervention for this purpose is sanctioned by the best
international authority

```
(d) Danger of undue collection is slight and can be avoided entirely by
```

submission of claims to The Hague Tribunal before intervening.

```
Second speaker—Stone
```

[^2]:. _Armed intervention is necessary to secure justice in tropical_
_America_, for

```
(a) The governments of this section constantly repudiate just debts
```

(_b_) They insist that the final decision about claims shall rest with
their own corrupt courts

```
(c) They refuse to arbitrate sometimes.
```

```
Third speaker—Dennett
```

[^3]:. _Armed intervention is beneficial in its results_, because

```
(a) It inspires responsibility
```

```
(b) In administering custom houses it removes temptation to revolutions
```

```
(c) It gives confidence to desirable capital.
```

Among others, the following books were used in the preparation of the
arguments:

N. "The Monroe Doctrine," by T.B. Edgington. Chapters [^2]:[^2]:-[^2]:[^8]:.
"Digest of International Law," by J.B. Moore. Report of Penfield of

```
proceedings before Hague Tribunal in 1903.
```

```
"Statesman's Year Book" (for statistics).
```

A. Minister Drago's appeal to the United States, in Foreign

```
Relations of United States, 1903.

"Journal of Political Economy," December, 1906.
```

```
"Atlantic Monthly," October, 1906.
```

```
"North American Review," Vol. 183, p. 602.
```

All of these contain material valuable for both sides, except those marked "N"
and "A," which are useful only for the negative and affirmative, respectively.

NOTE:—Practise in debating is most helpful to the public speaker, but if possible
each debate should be under the supervision of some person whose word will be
respected, so that the debaters might show regard for courtesy, accuracy,
effective reasoning, and the necessity for careful preparation. The Appendix
contains a list of questions for debate.

[^2]:[^5]:. Are the following points well considered?

THE INHERITANCE TAX IS NOT A GOOD SOCIAL REFORM MEASURE

A. Does not strike at the root of the evil

[^1]:. _Fortunes not a menace in themselves_ A fortune of $[^5]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: may
be a greater social evil than one of $[^5]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,000

```
2. Danger of wealth depends on its wrong accumulation and use
```

[^3]:. _Inheritance tax will not prevent rebates, monopoly,_
_discrimination, bribery, etc._

[^4]:. _Laws aimed at unjust accumulation and use of wealth furnish the_
_true remedy._

B. It would be evaded

```
1. Low rates are evaded
```

```
2. Rate must be high to result in distribution of great fortunes.
```

[^2]:[^6]:. Class exercises: Mock Trial for (_a_) some serious political offense; (_b_) a
burlesque offense.

INFLUENCING BY PERSUASION
```

```
She hath prosperous art
When she will play with reason and discourse,
And well she can persuade.

```
—SHAKESPEARE, Measure for Measure.
```

```
Him we call an artist who shall play on an assembly of men as a
master on the keys of a piano,—who seeing the people furious, shall
soften and compose them, shall draw them, when he will, to laughter
and to tears. Bring him to his audience, and, be they who they may,
```

```
—coarse or refined, pleased or displeased, sulky or savage, with
their opinions in the keeping of a confessor or with their opinions in
their bank safes,—he will have them pleased and humored as he
chooses; and they shall carry and execute what he bids them.
```

```
—RALPH WALDO EMERSON, Essay on Eloquence.
```

More good and more ill have been effected by persuasion than by any other form
of speech. _It is an attempt to influence by means of appeal to some particular_
_interest held important by the hearer._ Its motive may be high or low, fair or
unfair, honest or dishonest, calm or passionate, and hence its scope is
unparalleled in public speaking.

This "instilment of conviction," to use Matthew Arnold's expression, is naturally
a complex process in that it usually includes argumentation and often employs
suggestion, as the next chapter will illustrate. In fact, there is little public
speaking worthy of the name that is not in some part persuasive, for men rarely
speak solely to alter men's opinions—the ulterior purpose is almost always
action.

The nature of persuasion is not solely intellectual, but is largely emotional. It
uses every principle of public speaking, and every "form of discourse," to use a
rhetorician's expression, but argument supplemented by special appeal is its
peculiar quality. This we may best see by examining

_The Methods of Persuasion_

High-minded speakers often seek to move their hearers to action by an appeal to
their highest motives, such as love of liberty. Senator Hoar, in pleading for action
on the Philippine question, used this method:

```
What has been the practical statesmanship which comes from your
ideals and your sentimentalities? You have wasted nearly six
hundred millions of treasure. You have sacrificed nearly ten
thousand American lives—the flower of our youth. You have
devastated provinces. You have slain uncounted thousands of the
people you desire to benefit. You have established reconcentration
camps. Your generals are coming home from their harvest bringing
sheaves with them, in the shape of other thousands of sick and
wounded and insane to drag out miserable lives, wrecked in body
and mind. You make the American flag in the eyes of a numerous
```

```
people the emblem of sacrilege in Christian churches, and of the
burning of human dwellings, and of the horror of the water torture.
Your practical statesmanship which disdains to take George
Washington and Abraham Lincoln or the soldiers of the Revolution
or of the Civil War as models, has looked in some cases to Spain for
your example. I believe—nay, I know—that in general our officers
and soldiers are humane. But in some cases they have carried on
your warfare with a mixture of American ingenuity and Castilian
cruelty.
```

```
Your practical statesmanship has succeeded in converting a people
who three years ago were ready to kiss the hem of the garment of the
American and to welcome him as a liberator, who thronged after
your men, when they landed on those islands, with benediction and
gratitude, into sullen and irreconcilable enemies, possessed of a
hatred which centuries cannot eradicate.
```

```
Mr. President, this is the eternal law of human nature. You may
struggle against it, you may try to escape it, you may persuade
yourself that your intentions are benevolent, that your yoke will be
easy and your burden will be light, but it will assert itself again.
Government without the consent of the governed—authority which
heaven never gave—can only be supported by means which heaven
never can sanction.
```

```
The American people have got this one question to answer. They
may answer it now; they can take ten years, or twenty years, or a
generation, or a century to think of it. But will not down. They must
answer it in the end: Can you lawfully buy with money, or get by
brute force of arms, the right to hold in subjugation an unwilling
people, and to impose on them such constitution as you, and not
they, think best for them?
```

Senator Hoar then went on to make another sort of appeal—the appeal to fact
and experience:

```
We have answered this question a good many times in the past. The
fathers answered it in 1776, and founded the Republic upon their
answer, which has been the corner-stone. John Quincy Adams and
James Monroe answered it again in the Monroe Doctrine, which
```

```
John Quincy Adams declared was only the doctrine of the consent of
the governed. The Republican party answered it when it took
possession of the force of government at the beginning of the most
brilliant period in all legislative history. Abraham Lincoln answered
it when, on that fatal journey to Washington in 1861, he announced
that as the doctrine of his political creed, and declared, with
prophetic vision, that he was ready to be assassinated for it if need
be. You answered it again yourselves when you said that Cuba, who
had no more title than the people of the Philippine Islands had to
their independence, of right ought to be free and independent.
```

```
—GEORGE F. HOAR.
```

Appeal to the things that man holds dear is another potent form of persuasion.

Joseph Story, in his great Salem speech ([^1]:[^8]:[^2]:[^8]:) used this method most
dramatically:

```
I call upon you, fathers, by the shades of your ancestors—by the
dear ashes which repose in this precious soil—by all you are, and all
you hope to be—resist every object of disunion, resist every
encroachment upon your liberties, resist every attempt to fetter your
consciences, or smother your public schools, or extinguish your
system of public instruction.
```

```
I call upon you, mothers, by that which never fails in woman, the
love of your offspring; teach them, as they climb your knees, or lean
on your bosoms, the blessings of liberty. Swear them at the altar, as
with their baptismal vows, to be true to their country, and never to
forget or forsake her.
```

```
I call upon you, young men, to remember whose sons you are;
whose inheritance you possess. Life can never be too short, which
brings nothing but disgrace and oppression. Death never comes too
soon, if necessary in defence of the liberties of your country.
```

```
I call upon you, old men, for your counsels, and your prayers, and
your benedictions. May not your gray hairs go down in sorrow to the
grave, with the recollection that you have lived in vain. May not
your last sun sink in the west upon a nation of slaves.
```

```
No; I read in the destiny of my country far better hopes, far brighter
visions. We, who are now assembled here, must soon be gathered to
the congregation of other days. The time of our departure is at hand,
to make way for our children upon the theatre of life. May God
speed them and theirs. May he who, at the distance of another
century, shall stand here to celebrate this day, still look round upon a
free, happy, and virtuous people. May he have reason to exult as we
do. May he, with all the enthusiasm of truth as well as of poetry,
exclaim, that here is still his country.—JOSEPH STORY.
```

The appeal to prejudice is effective—though not often, if ever, justifiable; yet so
long as special pleading endures this sort of persuasion will be resorted to.
Rudyard Kipling uses this method—as have many others on both sides—in
discussing the great European war. Mingled with the appeal to prejudice, Mr.
Kipling uses the appeal to self-interest; though not the highest, it is a powerful
motive in all our lives. Notice how at the last the pleader sweeps on to the
highest ground he can take. This is a notable example of progressive appeal,
beginning with a low motive and ending with a high one in such a way as to
carry all the force of prejudice yet gain all the value of patriotic fervor.

```
Through no fault nor wish of ours we are at war with Germany, the
power which owes its existence to three well-thought-out wars; the
power which, for the last twenty years, has devoted itself to
organizing and preparing for this war; the power which is now
fighting to conquer the civilized world.
```

```
For the last two generations the Germans in their books, lectures,
speeches and schools have been carefully taught that nothing less
than this world-conquest was the object of their preparations and
their sacrifices. They have prepared carefully and sacrificed greatly.
```

```
We must have men and men and men, if we, with our allies, are to
check the onrush of organized barbarism.
```

```
Have no illusions. We are dealing with a strong and magnificently
equipped enemy, whose avowed aim is our complete destruction.
The violation of Belgium, the attack on France and the defense
against Russia, are only steps by the way. The German's real
objective, as she always has told us, is England, and England's
wealth, trade and worldwide possessions.
```

```
If you assume, for an instant, that the attack will be successful,
England will not be reduced, as some people say, to the rank of a
second rate power, but we shall cease to exist as a nation. We shall
become an outlying province of Germany, to be administered with
that severity German safety and interest require.
```

```
We are against such a fate. We enter into a new life in which all the
facts of war that we had put behind or forgotten for the last hundred
years, have returned to the front and test us as they tested our
fathers. It will be a long and a hard road, beset with difficulties and
discouragements, but we tread it together and we will tread it
together to the end.
```

```
Our petty social divisions and barriers have been swept away at the
outset of our mighty struggle. All the interests of our life of six
weeks ago are dead. We have but one interest now, and that touches
the naked heart of every man in this island and in the empire.
```

```
If we are to win the right for ourselves and for freedom to exist on
earth, every man must offer himself for that service and that
sacrifice.
```

From these examples it will be seen that the particular way in which the speakers
appealed to their hearers was _by coming close home to their interests, and by_
_themselves showing emotion_—two very important principles which you must
keep constantly in mind.

To accomplish the former requires a deep knowledge of human motive in
general and an understanding of the particular audience addressed. What are the
motives that arouse men to action? Think of them earnestly, set them down on
the tablets of your mind, study how to appeal to them worthily. Then, what
motives would be likely to appeal to _your_ hearers? What are their ideals and
interests in life? A mistake in your estimate may cost you your case. To appeal to
pride in appearance would make one set of men merely laugh—to try to arouse
sympathy for the Jews in Palestine would be wasted effort among others. Study
your audience, feel your way, and when you have once raised a spark, fan it into
a flame by every honest resource you possess.

The larger your audience the more sure you are to find a universal basis of
appeal. A small audience of bachelors will not grow excited over the importance
of furniture insurance; most men can be roused to the defense of the freedom of

the press.

Patent medicine advertisement usually begins by talking about your pains—they
begin on your interests. If they first discussed the size and rating of their
establishment, or the efficacy of their remedy, you would never read the "ad." If
they can make you think you have nervous troubles you will even plead for a
remedy—they will not have to try to sell it.

The patent medicine men are pleading—asking you to invest your money in their
commodity—yet they do not appear to be doing so. They get over on your side
of the fence, and arouse a desire for their nostrums by appealing to your own
interests.

Recently a book-salesman entered an attorney's office in New York and inquired:
"Do you want to buy a book?" Had the lawyer wanted a book he would probably
have bought one without waiting for a book-salesman to call. The solicitor made
the same mistake as the representative who made his approach with: "I want to
sell you a sewing machine." They both talked only in terms of their own
interests.

The successful pleader must convert his arguments into terms of his hearers'
advantage. Mankind are still selfish, are interested in what will serve them.
Expunge from your address your own personal concern and present your appeal
in terms of the general good, and to do this you need not be insincere, for you
had better not plead any cause that is _not_ for the hearers' good. Notice how
Senator Thurston in his plea for intervention in Cuba and Mr. Bryan in his
"Cross of Gold" speech constituted themselves the apostles of humanity.

_Exhortation_ is a highly impassioned form of appeal frequently used by the pulpit
in efforts to arouse men to a sense of duty and induce them to decide their
personal courses, and by counsel in seeking to influence a jury. The great
preachers, like the great jury-lawyers, have always been masters of persuasion.

Notice the difference among these four exhortations, and analyze the motives
appealed to:

```
Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay! Let not a traitor live!
—SHAKESPEARE, Julius Cæsar.
```

```
Strike—till the last armed foe expires,
Strike—for your altars and your fires,
```

```
Strike—for the green graves of your sires,
God—and your native land!
```

```
—FITZ-GREENE HALLECK, Marco Bozzaris.

Believe, gentlemen, if it were not for those children, he would not
come here to-day to seek such remuneration; if it were not that, by
your verdict, you may prevent those little innocent defrauded
wretches from becoming wandering beggars, as well as orphans on
the face of this earth. Oh, I know I need not ask this verdict from
your mercy; I need not extort it from your compassion; I will receive
it from your justice. I do conjure you, not as fathers, but as
husbands:—not as husbands, but as citizens:—not as citizens, but as
men:—not as men, but as Christians:—by all your obligations,
public, private, moral, and religious; by the hearth profaned; by the
home desolated; by the canons of the living God foully spurned;—
save, oh: save your firesides from the contagion, your country from
the crime, and perhaps thousands, yet unborn, from the shame, and
sin, and sorrow of this example!

```
—CHARLES PHILLIPS, Appeal to the jury in behalf of Guthrie.
```

So I appeal from the men in silken hose who danced to music made
by slaves and called it freedom, from the men in bell-crown hats
who led Hester Prynne to her shame and called it religion, to that
Americanism which reaches forth its arms to smite wrong with
reason and truth, secure in the power of both. I appeal from the
patriarchs of New England to the poets of New England; from
Endicott to Lowell; from Winthrop to Longfellow; from Norton to
Holmes; and I appeal in the name and by the rights of that common
citizenship—of that common origin, back of both the Puritan and the
Cavalier, to which all of us owe our being. Let the dead past,
consecrated by the blood of its martyrs, not by its savage hatreds,
darkened alike by kingcraft and priestcraft—let the dead past bury
its dead. Let the present and the future ring with the song of the
singers. Blessed be the lessons they teach, the laws they make.
Blessed be the eye to see, the light to reveal. Blessed be tolerance,
sitting ever on the right hand of God to guide the way with loving
word, as blessed be all that brings us nearer the goal of true religion,
true republicanism, and true patriotism, distrust of watchwords and

```
labels, shams and heroes, belief in our country and ourselves. It was
not Cotton Mather, but John Greenleaf Whittier, who cried:
```

```
Dear God and Father of us all,
Forgive our faith in cruel lies,
Forgive the blindness that denies.
```

```
Cast down our idols—overturn
Our Bloody altars—make us see
Thyself in Thy humanity!
```

```
—HENRY WATTERSON, Puritan and Cavalier.
```

Goethe, on being reproached for not having written war songs against the
French, replied, "In my poetry I have never shammed. How could I have written
songs of hate without hatred?" Neither is it possible to plead with full efficiency
for a cause for which you do not feel deeply. Feeling is contagious as belief is
contagious. The speaker who pleads with real feeling for his own convictions
will instill his feelings into his listeners. Sincerity, force, enthusiasm, and above
all, feeling—these are the qualities that move multitudes and make appeals
irresistible. They are of far greater importance than technical principles of
delivery, grace of gesture, or polished enunciation—important as all these
elements must doubtless be considered. _Base_ your appeal on reason, but do not
end in the basement—let the building rise, full of deep emotion and noble
persuasion.

QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES

Oh, gentlemen, am I this day only the counsel of my client? No, no;
I am the advocate of humanity—of yourselves—your homes—your
wives—your families—your little children. I am glad that this case
exhibits such atrocity; unmarked as it is by any mitigatory feature, it
may stop the frightful advance of this calamity; it will be met now,
and marked with vengeance. If it be not, farewell to the virtues of
your country; farewell to all confidence between man and man;
farewell to that unsuspicious and reciprocal tenderness, without
```

```
which marriage is but a consecrated curse. If oaths are to be
violated, laws disregarded, friendship betrayed, humanity trampled,
national and individual honor stained, and if a jury of fathers and of
husbands will give such miscreancy a passport to their homes, and
wives, and daughters,—farewell to all that yet remains of Ireland!
But I will not cast such a doubt upon the character of my country.
Against the sneer of the foe, and the skepticism of the foreigner, I
will still point to the domestic virtues, that no perfidy could barter,
and no bribery can purchase, that with a Roman usage, at once
embellish and consecrate households, giving to the society of the
hearth all the purity of the altar; that lingering alike in the palace and
the cottage, are still to be found scattered over this land—the relic of
what she was—the source perhaps of what she may be—the lone,
the stately, and magnificent memorials, that rearing their majesty
amid surrounding ruins, serve at once as the landmarks of the
departed glory, and the models by which the future may be erected.
```

```
Preserve those virtues with a vestal fidelity; mark this day, by your
verdict, your horror of their profanation; and believe me, when the
hand which records that verdict shall be dust, and the tongue that
asks it, traceless in the grave, many a happy home will bless its
consequences, and many a mother teach her little child to hate the
impious treason of adultery.

CHAPTER XXV

```
INFLUENCING THE CROWD
```

```
Success in business, in the last analysis, turns upon touching the
imagination of crowds. The reason that preachers in this present
generation are less successful in getting people to want goodness
than business men are in getting them to want motorcars, hats, and
pianolas, is that business men as a class are more close and desperate
students of human nature, and have boned down harder to the art of
touching the imaginations of the crowds.—GERALD STANLEY LEE,
Crowds.
```

In the early part of July, [^1]:[^9]:[^1]:[^4]:, a collection of Frenchmen in Paris, or Germans in
Berlin, was not a crowd in a psychological sense. Each individual had his own
special interests and needs, and there was no powerful common idea to unify
them. A group then represented only a collection of individuals. A month later,
any collection of Frenchmen or Germans formed a crowd: Patriotism, hate, a
common fear, a pervasive grief, had unified the individuals.

The psychology of the crowd is far different from the psychology of the personal
members that compose it. The crowd is a distinct entity. Individuals restrain and
subdue many of their impulses at the dictates of reason. The crowd never
reasons. It only feels. As persons there is a sense of responsibility attached to our
actions which checks many of our incitements, but the sense of responsibility is
lost in the crowd because of its numbers. The crowd is exceedingly suggestible
and will act upon the wildest and most extreme ideas. The crowd-mind is
primitive and will cheer plans and perform actions which its members would
utterly repudiate.

A mob is only a highly-wrought crowd. Ruskin's description is fitting: "You can
talk a mob into anything; its feelings may be—usually are—on the whole,
generous and right, but it has no foundation for them, no hold of them. You may
tease or tickle it into anything at your pleasure. It thinks by infection, for the
most part, catching an opinion like a cold, and there is nothing so little that it
will not roar itself wild about, when the fit is on, nothing so great but it will

forget in an hour when the fit is past."[[^2][^8]]

History will show us how the crowd-mind works. The medieval mind was not
given to reasoning; the medieval man attached great weight to the utterance of
authority; his religion touched chiefly the emotions. These conditions provided a
rich soil for the propagation of the crowd-mind when, in the eleventh century,
flagellation, a voluntary self-scourging, was preached by the monks. Substituting
flagellation for reciting penitential psalms was advocated by the reformers. A
scale was drawn up, making one thousand strokes equivalent to ten psalms, or
fifteen thousand to the entire psalter. This craze spread by leaps—and crowds.
Flagellant fraternities sprang up. Priests carrying banners led through the streets
great processions reciting prayers and whipping their bloody bodies with
leathern thongs fitted with four iron points. Pope Clement denounced this
practise and several of the leaders of these processions had to be burned at the
stake before the frenzy could be uprooted.

All western and central Europe was turned into a crowd by the preaching of the
crusaders, and millions of the followers of the Prince of Peace rushed to the
Holy Land to kill the heathen. Even the children started on a crusade against the
Saracens. The mob-spirit was so strong that home affections and persuasion
could not prevail against it and thousands of mere babes died in their attempts to
reach and redeem the Sacred Sepulchre.

In the early part of the eighteenth century the South Sea Company was formed in

England. Britain became a speculative crowd. Stock in the South Sea Company
rose from [^1]:[^2]:[^8]:-[^1]:/[^2]: points in January to [^5]:[^5]:[^0]: in May, and scored [^1]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: in July.
Five million shares were sold at this premium. Speculation ran riot. Hundreds of
companies were organized. One was formed "for a wheel of perpetual motion."
Another never troubled to give any reason at all for taking the cash of its
subscribers—it merely announced that it was organized "for a design which will
hereafter be promulgated." Owners began to sell, the mob caught the suggestion,
a panic ensued, the South Sea Company stock fell [^8]:[^0]:[^0]: points in a few days, and
more than a billion dollars evaporated in this era of frenzied speculation.

The burning of the witches at Salem, the Klondike gold craze, and the forty-
eight people who were killed by mobs in the United States in [^1]:[^9]:[^1]:[^3]:, are examples
familiar to us in America.

_The Crowd Must Have a Leader_

The leader of the crowd or mob is its determining factor. He becomes self-
hynoptized with the idea that unifies its members, his enthusiasm is contagious
—and so is theirs. The crowd acts as he suggests. The great mass of people do
not have any very sharply-drawn conclusions on any subject outside of their own
little spheres, but when they become a crowd they are perfectly willing to accept
ready-made, hand-me-down opinions. They will follow a leader at all costs—in
labor troubles they often follow a leader in preference to obeying their
government, in war they will throw self-preservation to the bushes and follow a
leader in the face of guns that fire fourteen times a second. The mob becomes
shorn of will-power and blindly obedient to its dictator. The Russian
Government, recognizing the menace of the crowd-mind to its autocracy,
formerly prohibited public gatherings. History is full of similar instances.

_How the Crowd is Created_

Today the crowd is as real a factor in our socialized life as are magnates and
monopolies. It is too complex a problem merely to damn or praise it—it must be
reckoned with, and mastered. The present problem is how to get the most and the
best out of the crowd-spirit, and the public speaker finds this to be peculiarly his
own question. His influence is multiplied if he can only transmute his audience
into a crowd. His affirmations must be their conclusions.

This can be accomplished by unifying the minds and needs of the audience and
arousing their emotions. Their feelings, not their reason, must be played upon
—_it is "up to" him to do this nobly_. Argument has its place on the platform, but

even its potencies must subserve the speaker's plan of attack to _win possession_ of
his audience.

Reread the chapter on "Feeling and Enthusiasm." It is impossible to make an
audience a crowd without appealing to their emotions. Can you imagine the
average group becoming a crowd while hearing a lecture on Dry Fly Fishing, or
on Egyptian Art? On the other hand, it would not have required world-famous
eloquence to have turned any audience in Ulster, in [^1]:[^9]:[^1]:[^4]:, into a crowd by
discussing the Home Rule Act. The crowd-spirit depends largely on the subject
used to fuse their individualities into one glowing whole.

Note how Antony played upon the feelings of his hearers in the famous funeral
oration given by Shakespeare in "Julius Cæsar." From murmuring units the men
became a unit—a mob.

```
ANTONY'S ORATION OVER CÆSAR'S BODY
```

```
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears;
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones:
So let it be with Cæsar! The Noble Brutus
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious.
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it.
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest—
For Brutus is an honorable man,
```

```
So are they all, all honorable men—
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept;
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
```

You all did see, that, on the Lupercal,
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And sure, he is an honorable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause;
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me;
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar,
And I must pause till it come back to me. [_Weeps._

[^1]: _Plebeian._ Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.

[^2]: _Ple._ If thou consider rightly of the matter,
Cæsar has had great wrong.

[^3]: _Ple._ Has he, masters?
I fear there will a worse come in his place.

[^4]: _Ple._ Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;
Therefore, 'tis certain, he was not ambitious.

[^1]: _Ple._ If it be found so, some will dear abide it.

[^2]: _Ple._ Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.

[^3]: _Ple._ There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.

[^4]: _Ple._ Now mark him, he begins again to speak.

_Ant._ But yesterday, the word of Cæsar might
Have stood against the world: now lies he there,
And none so poor to do him reverence.

Oh, masters! if I were dispos'd to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
Who, you all know, are honorable men.
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself, and you,
Than I will wrong such honorable men.
But here's a parchment, with the seal of Cæsar;
I found it in his closet; 'tis his will:
Let but the commons hear this testament—
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read—
And they would go and kiss dead Cæsar's wounds,
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood;
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy

Unto their issue.

[^4]: _Ple._ We'll hear the will: Read it, Mark Antony.

_All._ The will! the will! we will hear Cæsar's will.

_Ant._ Have patience, gentle friends: I must not read it;
It is not meet you know how Cæsar lov'd you.
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
And, being men, hearing the will of Cæsar,
It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
For if you should, oh, what would come of it!

[^4]: _Ple._ Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony!
You shall read us the will! Cæsar's will!

_Ant._ Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?
I have o'ershot myself, to tell you of it.
I fear I wrong the honorable men
Whose daggers have stab'd Cæsar; I do fear it.

[^4]: _Ple._ They were traitors: Honorable men!

_All._ The will! the testament!

[^2]: _Ple._ They were villains, murtherers! The will! Read the
will!

_Ant._ You will compel me then to read the will?
Then, make a ring about the corpse of Cæsar,
And let me shew you him that made the will.
Shall I descend? And will you give me leave?

_All._ Come down.

[^2]: _Ple._ Descend. [_He comes down from the Rostrum_.

[^3]: _Ple._ You shall have leave.

[^4]: _Ple._ A ring; stand round.

[^1]: _Ple._ Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.

[^2]: _Ple._ Room for Antony!—most noble Antony!

_Ant._ Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.

_All._ Stand back! room! bear back!

_Ant._ If you have tears, prepare to shed them now;
You all do know this mantle: I remember
The first time ever Cæsar put it on;
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
That day he overcame the Nervii.
Look, in this place, ran Cassius' dagger through:
See, what a rent the envious Casca made:
Through this, the well-beloved Brutus stab'd;
And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
Mark how the blood of Cæsar follow'd it!—
As rushing out of doors, to be resolv'd
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
For Brutus, as you know, was Cæsar's angel:
Judge, O you Gods, how Cæsar lov'd him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all!
For when the noble Cæsar saw him stab,
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
And in his mantle muffling up his face,
Even at the base of Pompey's statue,
Which all the while ran blood, great Cæsar fell.
Oh what a fall was there, my countrymen!
Then I and you, and all of us, fell down,
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
Oh! now you weep; and I perceive you feel
The dint of pity; these are gracious drops.
Kind souls! what, weep you, when you but behold
Our Cæsar's vesture wounded? Look you here!
Here is himself, mar'd, as you see, by traitors.

[^1]: _Ple._ Oh, piteous spectacle!

[^2]: _Ple._ Oh, noble Cæsar!

[^3]: _Ple._ Oh, woful day!

[^4]: _Ple._ Oh, traitors, villains!

[^1]: _Ple._ Oh, most bloody sight!

[^2]: _Ple._ We will be reveng'd!

_All._ Revenge; about—seek—burn—fire—kill—day!—Let
not
a traitor live!

_Ant._ Stay, countrymen.

[^1]: _Ple._ Peace there! Hear the noble Antony.

[^2]: _Ple._ We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.

_Ant._ Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny:
They that have done this deed are honorable:
What private griefs they have, alas! I know not,
That made them do it; they are wise, and honorable,
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts;
I am no orator, as Brutus is;
But as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
That love my friend, and that they know full well
That gave me public leave to speak of him:
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
To stir men's blood. I only speak right on:
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
Show your sweet Cæsar's wounds, poor, poor, dumb
mouths,
And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,

And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue
In every wound of Cæsar, that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.

_All._ We'll mutiny!

[^1]: _Ple._ We'll burn the house of Brutus.

[^3]: _Ple._ Away, then! Come, seek the conspirators.

_Ant._ Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.

_All._ Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony.

_Ant._ Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.
Wherein hath Cæsar thus deserv'd your loves?
Alas! you know not!—I must tell you then.
You have forgot the will I told you of.

_Ple._ Most true;—the will!—let's stay, and hear the will.

_Ant._ Here is the will, and under Cæsar's seal.
To every Roman citizen he gives,
To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.

[^2]: _Ple._ Most noble Cæsar!—we'll revenge his death.

[^3]: _Ple._ O royal Cæsar!

_Ant._ Hear me with patience.

_All._ Peace, ho!

_Ant._ Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
His private arbours, and new-planted orchards,
On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,
And to your heirs forever, common pleasures,
To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
Here was a Cæsar! When comes such another?

```
1 Ple. Never, never!—Come, away, away!
We'll burn his body in the holy place,
And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
Take up the body.
```

```
2 Ple. Go, fetch fire.
```

```
3 Ple. Pluck down benches.
```

```
4 Ple. Pluck down forms, windows, anything.
[Exeunt Citizens, with the body.
```

```
Ant. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
Take thou what course thou wilt!
```

To unify single, auditors into a crowd, express their common needs, aspirations,
dangers, and emotions, deliver your message so that the interests of one shall
appear to be the interests of all. The conviction of one man is intensified in
proportion as he finds others sharing his belief—_and feeling_. Antony does not
stop with telling the Roman populace that Cæsar fell—he makes the tragedy
universal:

```
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
Whilst bloody treason flourished over us.
```

Applause, generally a sign of feeling, helps to unify an audience. The nature of
the crowd is illustrated by the contagion of applause. Recently a throng in a New
York moving-picture and vaudeville house had been applauding several songs,
and when an advertisement for tailored skirts was thrown on the screen some
one started the applause, and the crowd, like sheep, blindly imitated—until
someone saw the joke and laughed; then the crowd again followed a leader and
laughed at and applauded its own stupidity.

Actors sometimes start applause for their lines by snapping their fingers. Some
one in the first few rows will mistake it for faint applause, and the whole theatre
will chime in.

An observant auditor will be interested in noticing the various devices a
monologist will use to get the first round of laughter and applause. He works so
hard because he knows an audience of units is an audience of indifferent critics,

but once get them to laughing together and each single laugher sweeps a number
of others with him, until the whole theatre is aroar and the entertainer has scored.
These are meretricious schemes, to be sure, and do not savor in the least of
inspiration, but crowds have not changed in their nature in a thousand years and
the one law holds for the greatest preacher and the pettiest stump-speaker—you
must fuse your audience or they will not warm to your message. The devices of
the great orator may not be so obvious as those of the vaudeville monologist, but
the principle is the same: he tries to strike some universal note that will have all
his hearers feeling alike at the same time.

The evangelist knows this when he has the soloist sing some touching song just
before the address. Or he will have the entire congregation sing, and that is the
psychology of "Now _every_body sing!" for he knows that they who will not join
in the song are as yet outside the crowd. Many a time has the popular evangelist
stopped in the middle of his talk, when he felt that his hearers were units instead
of a molten mass (and a sensitive speaker can feel that condition most
depressingly) and suddenly demanded that everyone arise and sing, or repeat
aloud a familiar passage, or read in unison; or perhaps he has subtly left the
thread of his discourse to tell a story that, from long experience, he knew would
not fail to bring his hearers to a common feeling.

These things are important resources for the speaker, and happy is he who uses
them worthily and not as a despicable charlatan. The difference between a
demagogue and a leader is not so much a matter of method as of principle. Even
the most dignified speaker must recognize the eternal laws of human nature. You
are by no means urged to become a trickster on the platform—far from it!—but
don't kill your speech with dignity. To be icily correct is as silly as to rant. Do
neither, but appeal to those world-old elements in your audience that have been
recognized by all great speakers from Demosthenes to Sam Small, and see to it
that you never debase your powers by arousing your hearers unworthily.

It is as hard to kindle enthusiasm in a scattered audience as to build a fire with
scattered sticks. An audience to be converted into a crowd must be made to
appear as a crowd. This cannot be done when they are widely scattered over a
large seating space or when many empty benches separate the speaker from his
hearers. Have your audience seated compactly. How many a preacher has
bemoaned the enormous edifice over which what would normally be a large
congregation has scattered in chilled and chilling solitude Sunday after Sunday!
Bishop Brooks himself could not have inspired a congregation of one thousand
souls seated in the vastness of St. Peter's at Rome. In that colossal sanctuary it is

only on great occasions which bring out the multitudes that the service is before
the high altar—at other times the smaller side-chapels are used.

Universal ideas surcharged with feeling help to create the crowd-atmosphere.
Examples: liberty, character, righteousness, courage, fraternity, altruism, country,
and national heroes. George Cohan was making psychology practical and
profitable when he introduced the flag and flag-songs into his musical comedies.
Cromwell's regiments prayed before the battle and went into the fight singing
hymns. The French corps, singing the Marseillaise in [^1]:[^9]:[^1]:[^4]:, charged the Germans
as one man. Such unifying devices arouse the feelings, make soldiers fanatical
mobs—and, alas, more efficient murderers.

CHAPTER XXVI

```
RIDING THE WINGED HORSE
```

```
To think, and to feel, constitute the two grand divisions of men of
genius—the men of reasoning and the men of imagination.
```

```
—ISAAC DISRAELI, Literary Character of Men of Genius.
```

```
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name.
```

```
—SHAKESPEARE, Midsummer-Night's Dream.
```

It is common, among those who deal chiefly with life's practicalities, to think of
imagination as having little value in comparison with direct thinking. They smile
with tolerance when Emerson says that "Science does not know its debt to the
imagination," for these are the words of a speculative essayist, a philosopher, a

poet. But when Napoleon—the indomitable welder of empires—declares that
"The human race is governed by its imagination," the authoritative word
commands their respect.

Be it remembered, the faculty of forming _mental images_ is as efficient a cog as
may be found in the whole mind-machine. True, it must fit into that other vital
cog, pure thought, but when it does so it may be questioned which is the more
productive of important results for the happiness and well-being of man. This
should become more apparent as we go on.

```
I. WHAT IS IMAGINATION?
```

Let us not seek for a definition, for a score of varying ones may be found, but let
us grasp this fact: By imagination we mean either the faculty or the process of
forming mental images.

The subject-matter of imagination may be really existent in nature, or not at all
real, or a combination of both; it may be physical or spiritual, or both—the
mental image is at once the most lawless and the most law-abiding child that has
ever been born of the mind.

First of all, as its name suggests, the process of imagination—for we are thinking
of it now as a process rather than as a faculty—is memory at work. Therefore we
must consider it primarily as

[^1]:_. Reproductive Imagination_

We see or hear or feel or taste or smell something and the sensation passes away.
Yet we are conscious of a greater or lesser ability to reproduce such feelings at
will. Two considerations, in general, will govern the vividness of the image thus
evoked—the strength of the original impression, and the reproductive power of
one mind as compared with another. Yet every normal person will be able to
evoke images with some degree of clearness.

The fact that not all minds possess this imaging faculty in anything like equal
measure will have an important bearing on the public speaker's study of this
question. No man who does not feel at least some poetic impulses is likely to
aspire seriously to be a poet, yet many whose imaging faculties are so dormant
as to seem actually dead do aspire to be public speakers. To all such we say most
earnestly: Awaken your image-making gift, for even in the most coldly logical

discourse it is sure to prove of great service. It is important that you find out at
once just how full and how trustworthy is your imagination, for it is capable of
cultivation—as well as of abuse.

Francis Galton[[^2][^9]] says: "The French appear to possess the visualizing faculty in
a high degree. The peculiar ability they show in pre-arranging ceremonials and
fêtes of all kinds and their undoubted genius for tactics and strategy show that
they are able to foresee effects with unusual clearness. Their ingenuity in all
technical contrivances is an additional testimony in the same direction, and so is
their singular clearness of expression. Their phrase _figurez-vous_, or _picture to_
_yourself_, seems to express their dominant mode of perception. Our equivalent, of
'image,' is ambiguous."

But individuals differ in this respect just as markedly as, for instance, the Dutch
do from the French. And this is true not only of those who are classified by their
friends as being respectively imaginative or unimaginative, but of those whose
gifts or habits are not well known.

Let us take for experiment six of the best-known types of imaging and see in
practise how they arise in our own minds.

By all odds the most common type is, (a) _the visual image_. Children who more
readily recall things seen than things heard are called by psychologists "eye-
minded," and most of us are bent in this direction. Close your eyes now and re-
call—the word thus hyphenated is more suggestive—the scene around this
morning's breakfast table. Possibly there was nothing striking in the situation and
the image is therefore not striking. Then image any notable table scene in your
experience—how vividly it stands forth, because at the time you felt the
impression strongly. Just then you may not have been conscious of how strongly
the scene was laying hold upon you, for often we are so intent upon what we see
that we give no particular thought to the fact that it is impressing us. It may
surprise you to learn how accurately you are able to image a scene when a long
time has elapsed between the conscious focussing of your attention on the image
and the time when you saw the original.

(b) _The auditory image_ is probably the next most vivid of our recalled
experiences. Here association is potent to suggest similarities. Close out all the
world beside and listen to the peculiar wood-against-wood sound of the sharp
thunder among rocky mountains—the crash of ball against ten-pins may suggest
it. Or image (the word is imperfect, for it seems to suggest only the eye) the

sound of tearing ropes when some precious weight hangs in danger. Or recall the
bay of a hound almost upon you in pursuit—choose your own sound, and see
how pleasantly or terribly real it becomes when imaged in your brain.

(c) _The motor image_ is a close competitor with the auditory for second place.
Have you ever awakened in the night, every muscle taut and striving, to feel
your self straining against the opposing football line that held like a stone-wall—
or as firmly as the headboard of your bed? Or voluntarily recall the movement of
the boat when you cried inwardly, "It's all up with me!" The perilous lurch of a
train, the sudden sinking of an elevator, or the unexpected toppling of a rocking-
chair may serve as further experiments.

(d) _The gustatory image_ is common enough, as the idea of eating lemons will
testify. Sometimes the pleasurable recollection of a delightful dinner will cause
the mouth to water years afterward, or the "image" of particularly atrocious
medicine will wrinkle the nose long after it made one day in boyhood wretched.

(e) _The olfactory image_ is even more delicate. Some there are who are affected
to illness by the memory of certain odors, while others experience the most
delectable sensations by the rise of pleasing olfactory images.

(f) _The tactile image_, to name no others, is well nigh as potent. Do you shudder
at the thought of velvet rubbed by short-nailed finger tips? Or were you ever
"burned" by touching an ice-cold stove? Or, happier memory, can you still feel
the touch of a well-loved absent hand?

Be it remembered that few of these images are present in our minds except in
combination—the sight and sound of the crashing avalanche are one; so are the
flash and report of the huntman's gun that came so near "doing for us."

Thus, imaging—especially conscious reproductive imagination—will become a
valuable part of our mental processes in proportion as we direct and control it.

[^2]:_. Productive Imagination_

All of the foregoing examples, and doubtless also many of the experiments you
yourself may originate, are merely reproductive. Pleasurable or horrific as these
may be, they are far less important than the images evoked by the productive
imagination—though that does not infer a separate faculty.

Recall, again for experiment, some scene whose beginning you once saw
enacted on a street corner but passed by before the dénouement was ready to be

disclosed. Recall it all—that far the image is reproductive. But what followed?
Let your fantasy roam at pleasure—the succeeding scenes are productive, for
you have more or less consciously invented the unreal on the basis of the real.

And just here the fictionist, the poet, and the public speaker will see the value of
productive imagery. True, the feet of the idol you build are on the ground, but its
head pierces the clouds, it is a son of both earth and heaven.

One fact it is important to note here: Imagery is a valuable mental asset in
proportion as it is controlled by the higher intellectual power of pure reason. The
untutored child of nature thinks largely in images and therefore attaches to them
undue importance. He readily confuses the real with the unreal—to him they are
of like value. But the man of training readily distinguishes the one from the other
and evaluates each with some, if not with perfect, justice.

So we see that unrestrained imaging may produce a rudderless steamer, while the
trained faculty is the graceful sloop, skimming the seas at her skipper's will, her
course steadied by the helm of reason and her lightsome wings catching every
air of heaven.

The game of chess, the war-lord's tactical plan, the evolution of a geometrical
theorem, the devising of a great business campaign, the elimination of waste in a
factory, the dénouement of a powerful drama, the overcoming of an economic
obstacle, the scheme for a sublime poem, and the convincing siege of an
audience may—nay, indeed must—each be conceived in an image and wrought
to reality according to the plans and specifications laid upon the trestle board by
some modern imaginative Hiram. The farmer who would be content with the
seed he possesses would have no harvest. Do not rest satisfied with the ability to
recall images, but cultivate your creative imagination by building "what might
be" upon the foundation of "what is."

```
II. THE USES OF IMAGING IN PUBLIC SPEAKING
```

By this time you will have already made some general application of these ideas
to the art of the platform, but to several specific uses we must now refer.

[^1]:_. Imaging in Speech-Preparation_

(a) _Set the image of your audience before you while you prepare._
Disappointment may lurk here, and you cannot be forearmed for every

emergency, but in the main you must meet your audience before you actually do
—image its probable mood and attitude toward the occasion, the theme, and the
speaker.

(b) _Conceive your speech as a whole while you are preparing its parts_, else can
you not see—image—how its parts shall be fitly framed together.

(c) _Image the language you will use_, so far as written or extemporaneous speech
may dictate. The habit of imaging will give you choice of varied figures of
speech, for remember that an address without _fresh_ comparisons is like a garden
without blooms. Do not be content with the first hackneyed figure that comes
flowing to your pen-point, but dream on until the striking, the unusual, yet the
vividly real comparison points your thought like steel does the arrow-tip.

Note the freshness and effectiveness of the following description from the
opening of O. Henry's story, "The Harbinger."

```
Long before the springtide is felt in the dull bosom of the yokel does
the city man know that the grass-green goddess is upon her throne.
He sits at his breakfast eggs and toast, begirt by stone walls, opens
his morning paper and sees journalism leave vernalism at the post.
```

```
For whereas Spring's couriers were once the evidence of our finer
senses, now the Associated Press does the trick.
```

```
The warble of the first robin in Hackensack, the stirring of the maple
sap in Bennington, the budding of the pussy willows along the main
street in Syracuse, the first chirp of the blue bird, the swan song of
the blue point, the annual tornado in St. Louis, the plaint of the
peach pessimist from Pompton, N.J., the regular visit of the tame
wild goose with a broken leg to the pond near Bilgewater Junction,
the base attempt of the Drug Trust to boost the price of quinine
foiled in the House by Congressman Jinks, the first tall poplar struck
by lightning and the usual stunned picknickers who had taken
refuge, the first crack of the ice jamb in the Allegheny River, the
finding of a violet in its mossy bed by the correspondent at Round
Corners—these are the advanced signs of the burgeoning season that
are wired into the wise city, while the farmer sees nothing but winter
upon his dreary fields.
```

```
But these be mere externals. The true harbinger is the heart. When
```

```
Strephon seeks his Chloe and Mike his Maggie, then only is Spring
arrived and the newspaper report of the five foot rattler killed in
Squire Pettregrew's pasture confirmed.
```

A hackneyed writer would probably have said that the newspaper told the city
man about spring before the farmer could see any evidence of it, but that the real
harbinger of spring was love and that "In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly
turns to thoughts of love."

[^2]:_. Imaging in Speech-Delivery_

When once the passion of speech is on you and you are "warmed up"—perhaps
by striking _till_ the iron is hot so that you may not fail to strike _when_ it is hot—
your mood will be one of vision.

Then (a) _Re-image past emotion_—of which more elsewhere. The actor re-calls
the old feelings every time he renders his telling lines.

(b) _Reconstruct in image the scenes you are to describe._

(c) _Image the objects in nature whose tone you are delineating_, so that bearing
and voice and movement (gesture) will picture forth the whole convincingly.
Instead of merely stating the fact that whiskey ruins homes, the temperance
speaker paints a drunkard coming home to abuse his wife and strike his children.
It is much more effective than telling the truth in abstract terms. To depict the
cruelness of war, do not assert the fact abstractly—"War is cruel." Show the
soldier, an arm swept away by a bursting shell, lying on the battlefield pleading
for water; show the children with tear-stained faces pressed against the window
pane praying for their dead father to return. Avoid general and prosaic terms.
Paint pictures. Evolve images for the imagination of your audience to construct
into pictures of their own.

```
III. HOW TO ACQUIRE THE IMAGING HABIT
```

You remember the American statesman who asserted that "the way to resume is
to resume"? The application is obvious. Beginning with the first simple analyses
of this chapter, test your own qualities of image-making. One by one practise the
several kinds of images; then add—even invent—others in combination, for
many images come to us in complex form, like the combined noise and shoving
and hot odor of a cheering crowd.

After practising on reproductive imaging, turn to the productive, beginning with
the reproductive and adding productive features for the sake of cultivating
invention.

Frequently, allow your originating gifts full swing by weaving complete
imaginary fabrics—sights, sounds, scenes; all the fine world of fantasy lies open
to the journeyings of your winged steed.

In like manner train yourself in the use of figurative language. Learn first to
distinguish and then to use its varied forms. _When used with restraint_, nothing
can be more effective than the trope; but once let extravagance creep in by the
window, and power will flee by the door.

All in all, master your images—let not them master you.

```
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES
```

[^1]:. Give original examples of each kind of reproductive imagination.

[^2]:. Build two of these into imaginary incidents for platform use, using your
productive, or creative, imagination.

[^3]:. Define (_a_) phantasy; (_b_) vision; (_c_) fantastic; (_d_) phantasmagoria; (_e_)
transmogrify; (_f_) recollection.

[^4]:. What is a "figure of speech"?

[^5]:. Define and give two examples of each of the following figures of speech[[^3][^0]].
At least one of the examples under each type would better be original. (_a_) simile;
(_b_) metaphor; (_c_) metonymy; (_d_) synecdoche; (_e_) apostrophe; (_f_) vision; (_g_)
personification; (_h_) hyperbole; (_i_) irony.

[^6]:. (_a_) What is an allegory? (_b_) Name one example. (_c_) How could a short
allegory be used as part of a public address?

[^7]:. Write a short fable[[^3][^1]] for use in a speech. Follow either the ancient form
(Æsop) or the modern (George Ade, Josephine Dodge Daskam).

[^8]:. What do you understand by "the historical present?" Illustrate how it may be
used (_ONLY_ occasionally) in a public address.

[^9]:. Recall some disturbance on the street, (_a_) Describe it as you would on the

platform; (_b_) imagine what preceded the disturbance; (_c_) imagine what followed
it; (_d_) connect the whole in a terse, dramatic narration for the platform and
deliver it with careful attention to all that you have learned of the public
speaker's art.

[^1]:[^0]:. Do the same with other incidents you have seen or heard of, or read of in the
newspapers.

NOTE: It is hoped that this exercise will be varied and expanded until the pupil
has gained considerable mastery of imaginative narration. (See chapter on
"Narration.")

[^1]:[^1]:. Experiments have proved that the majority of people think most vividly in
terms of visual images. However, some think more readily in terms of auditory
and motor images. It is a good plan to mix all kinds of images in the course of
your address for you will doubtless have all kinds of hearers. This plan will
serve to give variety and strengthen your effects by appealing to the several
senses of each hearer, as well as interesting many different auditors. For
exercise, (_a_) give several original examples of compound images, and (_b_)
construct brief descriptions of the scenes imagined. For example, the falling of a
bridge in process of building.

[^1]:[^2]:. Read the following observantly:

```
The strikers suffered bitter poverty last winter in New York.
```

```
Last winter a woman visiting the East Side of New York City saw
another woman coming out of a tenement house wringing her hands.
Upon inquiry the visitor found that a child had fainted in one of the
apartments. She entered, and saw the child ill and in rags, while the
father, a striker, was too poor to provide medical help. A physician
was called and said the child had fainted from lack of food. The only
food in the home was dried fish. The visitor provided groceries for
the family and ordered the milkman to leave milk for them daily. A
month later she returned. The father of the family knelt down before
her, and calling her an angel said that she had saved their lives, for
the milk she had provided was all the food they had had.
```

In the two preceding paragraphs we have substantially the same story, told twice.
In the first paragraph we have a fact stated in general terms. In the second, we
have an outline picture of a specific happening. Now expand this outline into a

dramatic recital, drawing freely upon your imagination.

```
GROWING A VOCABULARY
```

```
Boys flying kites haul in their white winged birds;
You can't do that way when you're flying words.
"Careful with fire," is good advice we know,
"Careful with words," is ten times doubly so.
Thoughts unexpressed many sometimes fall back
dead;
But God Himself can't kill them when they're said.
```

```
—WILL CARLETON, The First Settler's Story.
```

The term "vocabulary" has a special as well as a general meaning. True, _all_
vocabularies are grounded in the everyday words of the language, out of which
grow the special vocabularies, but each such specialized group possesses a
number of words of peculiar value for its own objects. These words may be used
in other vocabularies also, but the fact that they are suited to a unique order of
expression marks them as of special value to a particular craft or calling.

In this respect the public speaker differs not at all from the poet, the novelist, the
scientist, the traveler. He must add to his everyday stock, words of value for the
public presentation of thought. "A study of the discourses of effective orators
discloses the fact that they have a fondness for words signifying power,
largeness, speed, action, color, light, and all their opposites. They frequently

employ words expressive of the various emotions. Descriptive words, adjectives
used in _fresh_ relations with nouns, and apt epithets, are freely employed. Indeed,
the nature of public speech permits the use of mildly exaggerated words which,
by the time they have reached the hearer's judgment, will leave only a just

impression."[[^3][^2]]

_Form the Book-Note Habit_

To possess a word involves three things: To know its special and broader
meanings, to know its relation to other words, and to be able to use it. When you
see or hear a familiar word used in an unfamiliar sense, jot it down, look it up,
and master it. We have in mind a speaker of superior attainments who acquired
his vocabulary by noting all new words he heard or read. These he mastered and
_put into use_. Soon his vocabulary became large, varied, and exact. Use a new
word accurately five times and it is yours. Professor Albert E. Hancock says:
"An author's vocabulary is of two kinds, latent and dynamic: latent—those
words he understands; dynamic—those he can readily use. Every intelligent man
_knows_ all the words he needs, but he may not have them all ready for active
service. The problem of literary diction consists in turning the latent into the
dynamic." Your dynamic vocabulary is the one you must especially cultivate.

In his essay on "A College Magazine" in the volume, _Memories and Portraits_,
Stevenson shows how he rose from imitation to originality in the use of words.
He had particular reference to the formation of his literary style, but words are
the raw materials of style, and his excellent example may well be followed
judiciously by the public speaker. Words _in their relations_ are vastly more
important than words considered singly.

```
Whenever I read a book or a passage that particularly pleased me, in
which a thing was said or an effect rendered with propriety, in which
there was either some conspicuous force or some happy distinction
in the style, I must sit down at once and set myself to ape that
quality. I was unsuccessful, and I knew it; and tried again, and was
again unsuccessful, and always unsuccessful; but at least in these
vain bouts I got some practice in rhythm, in harmony, in
construction and coördination of parts.
```

```
I have thus played the sedulous ape to Hazlitt, to Lamb, to
Wordsworth, to Sir Thomas Browne, to Defoe, to Hawthorne, to
Montaigne.
```

```
That, like it or not, is the way to learn to write; whether I have
profited or not, that is the way. It was the way Keats learned, and
there never was a finer temperament for literature than Keats'.
```

```
It is the great point of these imitations that there still shines beyond
the student's reach, his inimitable model. Let him try as he please, he
is still sure of failure; and it is an old and very true saying that
failure is the only highroad to success.
```

_Form the Reference-Book Habit_

Do not be content with your general knowledge of a word—press your study
until you have mastered its individual shades of meaning and usage. Mere
fluency is sure to become despicable, but accuracy never. The dictionary
contains the crystallized usage of intellectual giants. No one who would write
effectively dare despise its definitions and discriminations. Think, for example,
of the different meanings of _mantle_, or _model_, or _quantity_. Any late edition of an
unabridged dictionary is good, and is worth making sacrifices to own.

Books of synonyms and antonyms—used cautiously, for there are few _perfect_
synonyms in any language—will be found of great help. Consider the shades of
meanings among such word-groups as _thief, peculator, defaulter, embezzler,_
_burglar, yeggman, robber, bandit, marauder, pirate_, and many more; or the
distinctions among _Hebrew, Jew, Israelite, and Semite_. Remember that no book
of synonyms is trustworthy unless used with a dictionary. "A Thesaurus of the
English Language," by Dr. Francis A. March, is expensive, but full and

authoritative. Of smaller books of synonyms and antonyms there are plenty.[[^3][^3]]

Study the connectives of English speech. Fernald's book on this title is a mine of
gems. Unsuspected pitfalls lie in the loose use of _and, or, for, while_, and a score
of tricky little connectives.

Word derivations are rich in suggestiveness. Our English owes so much to
foreign tongues and has changed so much with the centuries that whole
addresses may grow out of a single root-idea hidden away in an ancient word-
origin. Translation, also, is excellent exercise in word-mastery and consorts well
with the study of derivations.

Phrase books that show the origins of familiar expressions will surprise most of
us by showing how carelessly everyday speech is used. Brewer's "A Dictionary
of Phrase, and Fable," Edwards' "Words, Facts, and Phrases," and Thornton's

"An American Glossary," are all good—the last, an expensive work in three
volumes.

A prefix or a suffix may essentially change the force of the stem, as in _master-ful_
and _master-ly_, _contempt-ible_ and _contempt-uous, envi-ous_ and _envi-able_. Thus to
study words in groups, according to their stems, prefixes, and suffixes is to gain
a mastery over their shades of meaning, and introduce us to other related words.

_Do not Favor one Set or Kind of Words more than Another_

"Sixty years and more ago, Lord Brougham, addressing the students of the
University of Glasgow, laid down the rule that the native (Anglo-Saxon) part of
our vocabulary was to be favored at the expense of that other part which has
come from the Latin and Greek. The rule was an impossible one, and Lord
Brougham himself never tried seriously to observe it; nor, in truth, has any great
writer made the attempt. Not only is our language highly composite, but the
component words have, in De Quincey's phrase, 'happily coalesced.' It is easy to
jest at words in _-osity_ and _-ation_, as 'dictionary' words, and the like. But even
Lord Brougham would have found it difficult to dispense with _pomposity_ and

_imagination_."[[^3][^4]]

The short, vigorous Anglo-Saxon will always be preferred for passages of
special thrust and force, just as the Latin will continue to furnish us with flowing
and smooth expressions; to mingle all sorts, however, will give variety—and that
is most to be desired.

_Discuss Words With Those Who Know Them_

Since the language of the platform follows closely the diction of everyday
speech, many useful words may be acquired in conversation with cultivated
men, and when such discussion takes the form of disputation as to the meanings
and usages of words, it will prove doubly valuable. The development of word-
power marches with the growth of individuality.

_Search Faithfully for the Right Word_

Books of reference are tripled in value when their owner has a passion for
getting the kernels out of their shells. Ten minutes a day will do wonders for the
nut-cracker. "I am growing so peevish about my writing," says Flaubert. "I am
like a man whose ear is true, but who plays falsely on the violin: his fingers
refuse to reproduce precisely those sounds of which he has the inward sense.

Then the tears come rolling down from the poor scraper's eyes and the bow falls
from his hand."

The same brilliant Frenchman sent this sound advice to his pupil, Guy de
Maupassant: "Whatever may be the thing which one wishes to say, there is but
one word for expressing it, only one verb to animate it, only one adjective to
qualify it. It is essential to search for this word, for this verb, for this adjective,
until they are discovered, and to be satisfied with nothing else."

Walter Savage Landor once wrote: "I hate false words, and seek with care,
difficulty, and moroseness those that fit the thing." So did Sentimental Tommy,
as related by James M. Barrie in his novel bearing his hero's name as a title. No
wonder T. Sandys became an author and a lion!

Tommy, with another lad, is writing an essay on "A Day in Church," in
competition for a university scholarship. He gets on finely until he pauses for
lack of a word. For nearly an hour he searches for this elusive thing, until
suddenly he is told that the allotted time is up, and he has lost! Barrie may tell
the rest:

Essay! It was no more an essay than a twig is a tree, for the gowk
had stuck in the middle of his second page. Yes, stuck is the right
expression, as his chagrined teacher had to admit when the boy was
cross-examined. He had not been "up to some of his tricks;" he had
stuck, and his explanations, as you will admit, merely emphasized
his incapacity.

He had brought himself to public scorn for lack of a word. What
word? they asked testily; but even now he could not tell. He had
wanted a Scotch word that would signify how many people were in
church, and it was on the tip of his tongue, but would come no
farther. Puckle was nearly the word, but it did not mean so many
people as he meant. The hour had gone by just like winking; he had
forgotten all about time while searching his mind for the word.

The other five [examiners] were furious.... "You little tattie doolie,"
Cathro roared, "were there not a dozen words to wile from if you
had an ill-will to puckle? What ailed you at manzy, or—"

"I thought of manzy," replied Tommy, woefully, for he was ashamed
of himself, "but—but a manzy's a swarm. It would mean that the
folk in the kirk were buzzing thegither like bees, instead of sitting
still."

"Even if it does mean that," said Mr. Duthie, with impatience, "what
was the need of being so particular? Surely the art of essay-writing
consists in using the first word that comes and hurrying on."

"That's how I did," said the proud McLauchlan [Tommy's successful
competitor]....

"I see," interposed Mr. Gloag, "that McLauchlan speaks of there
being a mask of people in the church. Mask is a fine Scotch word."

"I thought of mask," whimpered Tommy, "but that would mean the
kirk was crammed, and I just meant it to be middling full."

"Flow would have done," suggested Mr. Lonimer.

"Flow's but a handful," said Tommy.

"Curran, then, you jackanapes!"

"Curran's no enough."

Mr. Lorrimer flung up his hands in despair.

"I wanted something between curran and mask," said Tommy,
doggedly, yet almost at the crying.

Mr. Ogilvy, who had been hiding his admiration with difficulty,
spread a net for him. "You said you wanted a word that meant
middling full. Well, why did you not say middling full—or fell
mask?"

"Yes, why not?" demanded the ministers, unconsciously caught in
the net.

"I wanted one word," replied Tommy, unconsciously avoiding it.

"You jewel!" muttered Mr. Ogilvy under his breath, but Mr. Cathro
would have banged the boy's head had not the ministers interfered.

"It is so easy, too, to find the right word," said Mr. Gloag.

"It's no; it's difficult as to hit a squirrel," cried Tommy, and again Mr.
Ogilvy nodded approval.

And then an odd thing happened. As they were preparing to leave
the school [Cathro having previously run Tommy out by the neck],
the door opened a little and there appeared in the aperture the face of
Tommy, tear-stained but excited. "I ken the word now," he cried, "it
came to me a' at once; it is hantle!"

Mr. Ogilvy... said in an ecstasy to himself, "He _had_ to think of it till
he got it—and he got it. The laddie is a genius!"

MEMORY TRAINING
```

```
Lulled in the countless chambers of the brain,
```

```
Our thoughts are linked by many a hidden chain;
Awake but one, and lo! what myriads rise!
Each stamps its image as the other flies!
```

```
Hail, memory, hail! in thy exhaustless mine
From age to age unnumber'd treasures shine!
Thought and her shadowy brood thy call obey,
And Place and Time are subject to thy sway!
```

```
—SAMUEL ROGERS, Pleasures of Memory.
```

Many an orator, like Thackeray, has made the best part of his speech to himself
—on the way home from the lecture hall. Presence of mind—it remained for
Mark Twain to observe—is greatly promoted by absence of body. A hole in the
memory is no less a common complaint than a distressing one.

Henry Ward Beecher was able to deliver one of the world's greatest addresses at
Liverpool because of his excellent memory. In speaking of the occasion Mr.
Beecher said that all the events, arguments and appeals that he had ever heard or
read or written seemed to pass before his mind as oratorical weapons, and
standing there he had but to reach forth his hand and "seize the weapons as they
went smoking by." Ben Jonson could repeat all he had written. Scaliger
memorized the Iliad in three weeks. Locke says: "Without memory, man is a
perpetual infant." Quintilian and Aristotle regarded it as a measure of genius.

Now all this is very good. We all agree that a reliable memory is an invaluable
possession for the speaker. We never dissent for a moment when we are
solemnly told that his memory should be a storehouse from which at pleasure he
can draw facts, fancies, and illustrations. But can the memory be trained to act as
the warder for all the truths that we have gained from thinking, reading, and
experience? And if so, how? Let us see.

Twenty years ago a poor immigrant boy, employed as a dish washer in New
York, wandered into the Cooper Union and began to read a copy of Henry
George's "Progress and Poverty." His passion for knowledge was awakened, and
he became a habitual reader. But he found that he was not able to remember
what he read, so he began to train his naturally poor memory until he became the
world's greatest memory expert. This man was the late Mr. Felix Berol. Mr.

Berol could tell the population of any town in the world, of more than five
thousand inhabitants. He could recall the names of forty strangers who had just
been introduced to him and was able to tell which had been presented third,
eighth, seventeenth, or in any order. He knew the date of every important event
in history, and could not only recall an endless array of facts but could correlate
them perfectly.

To what extent Mr. Berol's remarkable memory was natural and required only
attention, for its development, seems impossible to determine with exactness, but
the evidence clearly indicates that, however useless were many of his memory
feats, a highly retentive memory was developed where before only "a good
forgettery" existed.

The freak memory is not worth striving for, but a good working memory
decidedly is. Your power as a speaker will depend to a large extent upon your
ability to retain impressions and call them forth when occasion demands, and
that sort of memory is like muscle—it responds to training.

_What Not to Do_

It is sheer misdirected effort to begin to memorize by learning words by rote, for
that is beginning to build a pyramid at the apex. For years our schools were
cursed by this vicious system—vicious not only because it is inefficient but for
the more important reason that it hurts the mind. True, some minds are natively
endowed with a wonderful facility in remembering strings of words, facts, and
figures, but such are rarely good reasoning minds; the normal person must
belabor and force the memory to acquire in this artificial way.

Again, it is hurtful to force the memory in hours of physical weakness or mental
weariness. Health is the basis of the best mental action and the operation of
memory is no exception.

Finally, do not become a slave to a system. Knowledge of a few simple facts of
mind and memory will set you to work at the right end of the operation. Use
these _principles_, whether included in a system or not, but do not bind yourself to
a method that tends to lay more stress on the _way_ to remember than on the
development of memory itself. It is nothing short of ridiculous to memorize ten
words in order to remember one fact.

_The Natural Laws of Memory_

_Concentrated attention_ at the time when you wish to store the mind is the first
step in memorizing—and the most important one by far. You forgot the fourth of
the list of articles your wife asked you to bring home chiefly because you
allowed your attention to waver for an instant when she was telling you.
Attention may not be concentrated attention. When a siphon is charged with gas
it is sufficiently filled with the carbonic acid vapor to make its influence felt; a
mind charged with an idea is charged to a degree sufficient to hold it. Too much
charging will make the siphon burst; too much attention to trifles leads to
insanity. Adequate attention, then, is the fundamental secret of remembering.

Generally we do not give a fact adequate attention when it does not seem
important. Almost everyone has seen how the seeds in an apple point, and has
memorized the date of Washington's death. Most of us have—perhaps wisely—
forgotten both. The little nick in the bark of a tree is healed over and obliterated
in a season, but the gashes in the trees around Gettysburg are still apparent after
fifty years. Impressions that are gathered lightly are soon obliterated. Only deep
impressions can be recalled at will. Henry Ward Beecher said: "One intense hour
will do more than dreamy years." To memorize ideas and words, concentrate on
them until they are fixed firmly and deeply in your mind and accord to them
their true importance. LISTEN with the mind and you will remember.

How shall you concentrate? How would you increase the fighting-effectiveness
of a man-of-war? One vital way would be to increase the size and number of its
guns. To strengthen your memory, increase both the number and the force of
your mental impressions by attending to them intensely. Loose, skimming
reading, and drifting habits of reading destroy memory power. However, as most
books and newspapers do not warrant any other kind of attention, it will not do
altogether to condemn this method of reading; but avoid it when you are trying
to memorize.

Environment has a strong influence upon concentration, until you have learned
to be alone in a crowd and undisturbed by clamor. When you set out to
memorize a fact or a speech, you may find the task easier away from all sounds
and moving objects. All impressions foreign to the one you desire to fix in your
mind must be eliminated.

The next great step in memorizing is to _pick out the essentials of the subject_,
arrange them in order, and dwell upon them intently. Think clearly of each
essential, one after the other. _Thinking_ a thing—not allowing the mind to wander
to non-essentials—is really memorizing.

_Association of ideas_ is universally recognized as an essential in memory work;
indeed, whole systems of memory training have been founded on this principle.

Many speakers memorize only the outlines of their addresses, filling in the
words at the moment of speaking. Some have found it helpful to remember an
outline by associating the different points with objects in the room. Speaking on
"Peace," you may wish to dwell on the cost the cruelty, and the failure of war,
and so lead to the justice of arbitration. Before going on the platform if you will
associate four divisions of your outline with four objects in the room, this
association may help you to recall them. You may be prone to forget your third
point, but you remember that once when you were speaking the electric lights
failed, so arbitrarily the electric light globe will help you to remember "failure."
Such associations, being unique, tend to stick in the mind. While recently
speaking on the six kinds of imagination the present writer formed them into an
acrostic—_visual_, _auditory_, _motor_, _gustatory_, _olfactory_, and _tactile_, furnished the
nonsense word _vamgot_, but the six points were easily remembered.

In the same way that children are taught to remember the spelling of teasing
words—_separate_ comes from _separ_—and as an automobile driver remembers
that two C's and then two H's lead him into Castor Road, Cottman Street, Haynes
Street and Henry Street, so important points in your address may be fixed in
mind by arbitrary symbols invented by yourself. The very work of devising the
scheme is a memory action. The psychological process is simple: it is one of
noting intently the steps by which a fact, or a truth, or even a word, has come to
you. Take advantage of this tendency of the mind to remember by association.

_Repetition_ is a powerful aid to memory. Thurlow Weed, the journalist and
political leader, was troubled because he so easily forgot the names of persons he
met from day to day. He corrected the weakness, relates Professor William
James, by forming the habit of attending carefully to names he had heard during
the day and then repeating them to his wife every evening. Doubtless Mrs. Weed
was heroically longsuffering, but the device worked admirably.

After reading a passage you would remember, close the book, reflect, and repeat
the contents—aloud, if possible.

_Reading thoughtfully aloud_ has been found by many to be a helpful memory
practise.

_Write what you wish to remember._ This is simply one more way of increasing the
number and the strength of your mental impressions by utilizing _all_ your

avenues of impression. It will help to fix a speech in your mind if you speak it
aloud, listen to it, write it out, and look at it intently. You have then impressed it
on your mind by means of vocal, auditory, muscular and visual impressions.

Some folk have peculiarly distinct auditory memories; they are able to recall
things heard much better than things seen. Others have the visual memory; they
are best able to recall sight-impressions. As you recall a walk you have taken,
are you able to remember better the sights or the sounds? Find out what kinds of
impressions your memory retains best, and use them the most. To fix an idea in
mind, use _every_ possible kind of impression.

_Daily habit_ is a great memory cultivator. Learn a lesson from the Marathon
runner. Regular exercise, though never so little daily, will strengthen your
memory in a surprising measure. Try to describe in detail the dress, looks and
manner of the people you pass on the street. Observe the room you are in, close
your eyes, and describe its contents. View closely the landscape, and write out a
detailed description of it. How much did you miss? Notice the contents of the
show windows on the street; how many features are you able to recall?
Continual practise in this feat may develop in you as remarkable proficiency as it
did in Robert Houdin and his son.

The daily memorizing of a beautiful passage in literature will not only lend
strength to the memory, but will store the mind with gems for quotation. But
whether by little or much add daily to your memory power by practise.

_Memorize out of doors._ The buoyancy of the wood, the shore, or the stormy
night on deserted streets may freshen your mind as it does the minds of countless
others.

Lastly, _cast out fear_. Tell yourself that you _can_ and _will_ and _do_ remember. By
pure exercise of selfism assert your mastery. Be obsessed with the fear of
forgetting and you cannot remember. Practise the reverse. Throw aside your
manuscript crutches—you may tumble once or twice, but what matters that, for
you are going to learn to walk and leap and run.

_Memorizing a Speech_

Now let us try to put into practise the foregoing suggestions. First, reread this
chapter, noting the nine ways by which memorizing may be helped.

Then read over the following selection from Beecher, applying so many of the

suggestions as are practicable. Get the spirit of the selection firmly in your mind.
Make mental note of—write down, if you must—the _succession_ of ideas. Now
memorize the thought. Then memorize the outline, the order in which the
different ideas are expressed. Finally, memorize the exact wording.

No, when you have done all this, with the most faithful attention to directions,
you will not find memorizing easy, unless you have previously trained your
memory, or it is naturally retentive. Only by constant practise will memory
become strong and only by continually observing these same principles will it
remain strong. You will, however, have made a beginning, and that is no mean
matter.

THE REIGN OF THE COMMON PEOPLE
```

```
I do not suppose that if you were to go and look upon the experiment
of self-government in America you would have a very high opinion
of it. I have not either, if I just look upon the surface of things. Why,
men will say: "It stands to reason that 60,000,000 ignorant of law,
ignorant of constitutional history, ignorant of jurisprudence, of
finance, and taxes and tariffs and forms of currency—60,000,000
people that never studied these things—are not fit to rule." Your
diplomacy is as complicated as ours, and it is the most complicated
on earth, for all things grow in complexity as they develop toward a
higher condition. What fitness is there in these people? Well, it is not
democracy merely; it is a representative democracy. Our people do
not vote in mass for anything; they pick out captains of thought, they
pick out the men that do know, and they send them to the Legislature
to think for them, and then the people afterward ratify or disallow
them.
```

```
But when you come to the Legislature I am bound to confess that the
thing does not look very much more cheering on the outside. Do
they really select the best men? Yes; in times of danger they do very
generally, but in ordinary time, "kissing goes by favor." You know
what the duty of a regular Republican-Democratic legislator is. It is
to get back again next winter. His second duty is what? His second
duty is to put himself under that extraordinary providence that takes
care of legislators' salaries. The old miracle of the prophet and the
meal and the oil is outdone immeasurably in our days, for they go
there poor one year, and go home rich; in four years they become
```

```
moneylenders, all by a trust in that gracious providence that takes
care of legislators' salaries. Their next duty after that is to serve the
party that sent them up, and then, if there is anything left of them, it
belongs to the commonwealth. Someone has said very wisely, that if
a man traveling wishes to relish his dinner he had better not go into
the kitchen to see where it is cooked; if a man wishes to respect and
obey the law, he had better not go to the Legislature to see where
that is cooked.

_In Case of Trouble_

But what are you to do if, notwithstanding all your efforts, you should forget
your points, and your mind, for the minute, becomes blank? This is a deplorable
condition that sometimes arises and must be dealt with. Obviously, you can sit
down and admit defeat. Such a consummation is devoutly to be shunned.

Walking slowly across the platform may give you time to grip yourself, compose
your thoughts, and stave off disaster. Perhaps the surest and most practical
method is to begin a new sentence with your last important word. This is not
advocated as a method of composing a speech—it is merely an extreme measure
which may save you in tight circumstances. It is like the fire department—the
less you must use it the better. If this method is followed very long you are likely
to find yourself talking about plum pudding or Chinese Gordon in the most
unexpected manner, so of course you will get back to your lines the earliest
moment that your feet have hit the platform.

Let us see how this plan works—obviously, your extemporized words will lack
somewhat of polish, but in such a pass crudity is better than failure.

Now you have come to a dead wall after saying: "Joan of Arc fought for liberty."
By this method you might get something like this:

"Liberty is a sacred privilege for which mankind always had to fight. These
struggles [Platitude—but push on] fill the pages of history. History records the
gradual triumph of the serf over the lord, the slave over the master. The master
has continually tried to usurp unlimited powers. Power during the medieval ages

accrued to the owner of the land with a spear and a strong castle; but the strong
castle and spear were of little avail after the discovery of gunpowder.
Gunpowder was the greatest boon that liberty had ever known."

Thus far you have linked one idea with another rather obviously, but you are
getting your second wind now and may venture to relax your grip on the too-
evident chain; and so you say:

"With gunpowder the humblest serf in all the land could put an end to the life of
the tyrannical baron behind the castle walls. The struggle for liberty, with
gunpowder as its aid, wrecked empires, and built up a new era for all mankind."

In a moment more you have gotten back to your outline and the day is saved.

Practising exercises like the above will not only fortify you against the death of
your speech when your memory misses fire, but it will also provide an excellent
training for fluency in speaking. _Stock up with ideas._

```

The speaker's most valuable possession is personality—that indefinable,
imponderable something which sums up what we are, and makes us different
from others; that distinctive force of self which operates appreciably on those
whose lives we touch. It is personality alone that makes us long for higher
things. Rob us of our sense of individual life, with its gains and losses, its duties
and joys, and we grovel. "Few human creatures," says John Stuart Mill, "would
consent to be changed into any of the lower animals for a promise of the fullest
allowance of a beast's pleasures; no intelligent human being would consent to be
a fool, no instructed person would be an ignoramus, no person of feeling and
conscience would be selfish and base, even though he should be persuaded that
the fool, or the dunce, or the rascal is better satisfied with his lot than they with
theirs.... It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied, better to
be a Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool or the pig is of a
different opinion, it is only because they know only their own side of the
question. The other party to the comparison knows both sides."

Now it is precisely because the Socrates type of person lives on the plan of right
thinking and restrained feeling and willing that he prefers his state to that of the
animal. All that a man is, all his happiness, his sorrow, his achievements, his
failures, his magnetism, his weakness, all are in an amazingly large measure the
direct results of his thinking. Thought and heart combine to produce _right_

thinking: "As a man thinketh in his heart so is he." As he does not think in his
heart so he can never become.

Since this is true, personality can be developed and its latent powers brought out
by careful cultivation. We have long since ceased to believe that we are living in
a realm of chance. So clear and exact are nature's laws that we forecast, scores of
years in advance, the appearance of a certain comet and foretell to the minute an
eclipse of the Sun. And we understand this law of cause and effect in all our
material realms. We do not plant potatoes and expect to pluck hyacinths. The law
is universal: it applies to our mental powers, to morality, to personality, quite as
much as to the heavenly bodies and the grain of the fields. "Whatsoever a man
soweth that shall he also reap," and nothing else.

Character has always been regarded as one of the chief factors of the speaker's
power. Cato defined the orator as _vir bonus dicendi peritus_—a good man skilled
in speaking. Phillips Brooks says: "Nobody can truly stand as a utterer before the
world, unless he be profoundly living and earnestly thinking." "Character," says
Emerson, "is a natural power, like light and heat, and all nature cooperates with
it. The reason why we feel one man's presence, and do not feel another's is as
simple as gravity. Truth is the summit of being: justice is the application of it to
affairs. All individual natures stand in a scale, according to the purity of this
element in them. The will of the pure runs down into other natures, as water runs
down from a higher into a lower vessel. This natural force is no more to be
withstood than any other natural force.... Character is nature in the highest
form."

It is absolutely impossible for impure, bestial and selfish thoughts to blossom
into loving and altruistic habits. Thistle seeds bring forth only the thistle.
Contrariwise, it is entirely impossible for continual altruistic, sympathetic, and
serviceful thoughts to bring forth a low and vicious character. Either thoughts or
feelings precede and determine all our actions. Actions develop into habits,
habits constitute character, and character determines destiny. Therefore to guard
our thoughts and control our feelings is to shape our destinies. The syllogism is
complete, and old as it is it is still true.

Since "character is nature in the highest form," the development of character
must proceed on natural lines. The garden left to itself will bring forth weeds and
scrawny plants, but the flower-beds nurtured carefully will blossom into
fragrance and beauty.

As the student entering college largely determines his vocation by choosing from
the different courses of the curriculum, so do we choose our characters by
choosing our thoughts. We are steadily going up toward that which we most
wish for, or steadily sinking to the level of our low desires. What we secretly
cherish in our hearts is a symbol of what we shall receive. Our trains of thoughts
are hurrying us on to our destiny. When you see the flag fluttering to the South,
you know the wind is coming from the North. When you see the straws and
papers being carried to the Northward you realize the wind is blowing out of the
South. It is just as easy to ascertain a man's thoughts by observing the tendency
of his character.

Let it not be suspected for one moment that all this is merely a preachment on
the question of morals. It is that, but much more, for it touches the whole man—
his imaginative nature, his ability to control his feelings, the mastery of his
thinking faculties, and—perhaps most largely—his power to will and to carry his
volitions into effective action.

Right thinking constantly assumes that the will sits enthroned to execute the
dictates of mind, conscience and heart. _Never tolerate for an instant the_
_suggestion that your will is not absolutely efficient._ The way to will is to will—
and the very first time you are tempted to break a worthy resolution—and you
will be, you may be certain of that—_make your fight then and there_. You cannot
afford to lose that fight. You _must_ win it—don't swerve for an instant, but keep
that resolution if it kills you. It will not, but you must fight just as though life
depended on the victory; and indeed your personality may actually lie in the
balances!

Your success or failure as a speaker will be determined very largely by your
thoughts and your mental attitude. The present writer had a student of limited
education enter one of his classes in public speaking. He proved to be a very
poor speaker; and the instructor could conscientiously do little but point out
faults. However, the young man was warned not to be discouraged. With sorrow
in his voice and the essence of earnestness beaming from his eyes, he replied: "I
will not be discouraged! I want so badly to know how to speak!" It was warm,
human, and from the very heart. And he did keep on trying—and developed into
a creditable speaker.

There is no power under the stars that can defeat a man with that attitude. He
who down in the deeps of his heart earnestly longs to get facility in speaking,
and is willing to make the sacrifices necessary, will reach his goal. "Ask and ye

shall receive; seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you," is
indeed applicable to those who would acquire speech-power. You will not realize
the prize that you wish for languidly, but the goal that you start out to attain with
the spirit of the old guard that dies but never surrenders, you will surely reach.

Your belief in your ability and your willingness to make sacrifices for that belief,
are the double index to your future achievements. Lincoln had a dream of his
possibilities as a speaker. He transmuted that dream into life solely because he
walked many miles to borrow books which he read by the log-fire glow at night.
He sacrificed much to realize his vision. Livingstone had a great faith in his
ability to serve the benighted races of Africa. To actualize that faith he gave up
all. Leaving England for the interior of the Dark Continent he struck the death
blow to Europe's profits from the slave trade. Joan of Arc had great self-
confidence, glorified by an infinite capacity for sacrifice. She drove the English
beyond the Loire, and stood beside Charles while he was crowned.

These all realized their strongest desires. The law is universal. Desire greatly,
and you shall achieve; sacrifice much, and you shall obtain.

Stanton Davis Kirkham has beautifully expressed this thought: "You may be
keeping accounts, and presently you shall walk out of the door that has for so
long seemed to you the barrier of your ideals, and shall find yourself before an
audience—the pen still behind your ear, the ink stains on your fingers—and then
and there shall pour out the torrent of your inspiration. You may be driving
sheep, and you shall wander to the city—bucolic and open-mouthed; shall
wander under the intrepid guidance of the spirit into the studio of the master, and
after a time he shall say, 'I have nothing more to teach you.' And now you have
become the master, who did so recently dream of great things while driving
sheep. You shall lay down the saw and the plane to take upon yourself the
regeneration of the world."

AFTER-DINNER AND OTHER OCCASIONAL SPEAKING
```

```
The perception of the ludicrous is a pledge of sanity.

```
—RALPH WALDO EMERSON, Essays.
```

```
And let him be sure to leave other men their turns to speak.
```

```
—FRANCIS BACON, Essay on Civil and Moral Discourse.
```

Perhaps the most brilliant, and certainly the most entertaining, of all speeches are
those delivered on after-dinner and other special occasions. The air of well-fed
content in the former, and of expectancy well primed in the latter, furnishes an
audience which, though not readily won, is prepared for the best, while the
speaker himself is pretty sure to have been chosen for his gifts of oratory.

The first essential of good occasional speaking is to study the occasion. Precisely
what is the object of the meeting? How important is the occasion to the
audience? How large will the audience be? What sort of people are they? How
large is the auditorium? Who selects the speakers' themes? Who else is to speak?
What are they to speak about? Precisely how long am I to speak? Who speaks
before I do and who follows?

If you want to hit the nail on the head ask such questions as these.[[^3][^5]] No
occasional address can succeed unless it fits the occasion to a T. Many
prominent men have lost prestige because they were too careless or too busy or
too self-confident to respect the occasion and the audience by learning the exact
conditions under which they were to speak. Leaving _too_ much to the moment is
taking a long chance and generally means a less effective speech, if not a failure.

Suitability is the big thing in an occasional speech. When Mark Twain addressed
the Army of the Tennessee in reunion at Chicago, in [^1]:[^8]:[^7]:[^7]:, he responded to the
toast, "The Babies." Two things in that after-dinner speech are remarkable: the
bright introduction, by which he subtly _claimed_ the interest of all, and the

humorous use of military terms throughout:

```
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: "The Babies." Now, that's something
like. We haven't all had the good fortune to be ladies; we have not all
been generals, or poets, or statesmen; but when the toast works
down to the babies, we stand on common ground—for we've all
been babies. It is a shame that for a thousand years the world's
banquets have utterly ignored the baby, as if he didn't amount to
anything! If you, gentlemen, will stop and think a minute—if you
will go back fifty or a hundred years, to your early married life, and
recontemplate your first baby—you will remember that he amounted
to a good deal—and even something over.
```

"As a vessel is known by the sound, whether it be cracked or not," said
Demosthenes, "so men are proved by their speeches whether they be wise or
foolish." Surely the occasional address furnishes a severe test of a speaker's
wisdom. To be trivial on a serious occasion, to be funereal at a banquet, to be
long-winded ever—these are the marks of non-sense. Some imprudent souls
seem to select the most friendly of after-dinner occasions for the explosion of a
bomb-shell of dispute. Around the dinner table it is the custom of even political
enemies to bury their hatchets anywhere rather than in some convenient skull. It
is the height of bad taste to raise questions that in hours consecrated to good-will
can only irritate.

Occasional speeches offer good chances for humor, particularly the funny story,
for humor with a genuine point is not trivial. But do not spin a whole skein of
humorous yarns with no more connection than the inane and threadbare "And
that reminds me." An anecdote without bearing may be funny but one less funny
that fits theme and occasion is far preferable. There is no way, short of sheer
power of speech, that so surely leads to the heart of an audience as rich,
appropriate humor. The scattered diners in a great banqueting hall, the after-
dinner lethargy, the anxiety over approaching last-train time, the over-full list of
over-full speakers—all throw out a challenge to the speaker to do his best to win
an interested hearing. And when success does come it is usually due to a happy
mixture of seriousness and humor, for humor alone rarely scores so heavily as
the two combined, while the utterly grave speech _never_ does on such occasions.

If there is one place more than another where second-hand opinions and
platitudes are unwelcome it is in the after-dinner speech. Whether you are toast-
master or the last speaker to try to hold the waning crowd at midnight, be as

original as you can. How is it possible to summarize the qualities that go to make
up the good after-dinner speech, when we remember the inimitable serious-
drollery of Mark Twain, the sweet southern eloquence of Henry W. Grady, the
funereal gravity of the humorous Charles Battell Loomis, the charm of Henry
Van Dyke, the geniality of F. Hopkinson Smith, and the all-round delightfulness
of Chauncey M. Depew? America is literally rich in such gladsome speakers,
who punctuate real sense with nonsense, and so make both effective.

Commemorative occasions, unveilings, commencements, dedications, eulogies,
and all the train of special public gatherings, offer rare opportunities for the
display of tact and good sense in handling occasion, theme, and audience. When
to be dignified and when colloquial, when to soar and when to ramble arm in
arm with your hearers, when to flame and when to soothe, when to instruct and
when to amuse—in a word, the whole matter of APPROPRIATENESS must
constantly be in mind lest you write your speech on water.

Finally, remember the beatitude: Blessed is the man that maketh short speeches,
for he shall be invited to speak again.

LAST DAYS OF THE CONFEDERACY

(Extract)

```
The Rapidan suggests another scene to which allusion has often
been made since the war, but which, as illustrative also of the spirit
of both armies, I may be permitted to recall in this connection. In the
mellow twilight of an April day the two armies were holding their
dress parades on the opposite hills bordering the river. At the close
of the parade a magnificent brass band of the Union army played
with great spirit the patriotic airs, "Hail Columbia," and "Yankee
Doodle." Whereupon the Federal troops responded with a patriotic
shout. The same band then played the soul-stirring strains of
"Dixie," to which a mighty response came from ten thousand
Southern troops. A few moments later, when the stars had come out
as witnesses and when all nature was in harmony, there came from
the same band the old melody, "Home, Sweet Home." As its familiar
and pathetic notes rolled over the water and thrilled through the
spirits of the soldiers, the hills reverberated with a thundering
response from the united voices of both armies. What was there in
```

this old, old music, to so touch the chords of sympathy, so thrill the
spirits and cause the frames of brave men to tremble with emotion?
It was the thought of home. To thousands, doubtless, it was the
thought of that Eternal Home to which the next battle might be the
gateway. To thousands of others it was the thought of their dear
earthly homes, where loved ones at that twilight hour were bowing
round the family altar, and asking God's care over the absent soldier
boy.

_WELCOME TO KOSSUTH_

(Extract)

Let me ask you to imagine that the contest, in which the United
States asserted their independence of Great Britain, had been
unsuccessful; that our armies, through treason or a league of tyrants
against us, had been broken and scattered; that the great men who
led them, and who swayed our councils—our Washington, our
Franklin, and the venerable president of the American Congress—
had been driven forth as exiles. If there had existed at that day, in
any part of the civilized world, a powerful Republic, with
institutions resting on the same foundations of liberty which our own
countrymen sought to establish, would there have been in that
Republic any hospitality too cordial, any sympathy too deep, any
zeal for their glorious but unfortunate cause, too fervent or too active
to be shown toward these illustrious fugitives? Gentlemen, the case I
have supposed is before you. The Washingtons, the Franklins, the
Hancocks of Hungary, driven out by a far worse tyranny than was
ever endured here, are wanderers in foreign lands. Some of them
have sought a refuge in our country—one sits with this company our
guest to-night—and we must measure the duty we owe them by the
same standard which we would have had history apply, if our
ancestors had met with a fate like theirs.

_THE INFLUENCE OF UNIVERSITIES_

(Extract)

When the excitement of party warfare presses dangerously near our
national safeguards, I would have the intelligent conservatism of our
universities and colleges warn the contestants in impressive tones
against the perils of a breach impossible to repair.

When popular discontent and passion are stimulated by the arts of
designing partisans to a pitch perilously near to class hatred or
sectional anger, I would have our universities and colleges sound the
alarm in the name of American brotherhood and fraternal
dependence.

When the attempt is made to delude the people into the belief that
their suffrages can change the operation of national laws, I would
have our universities and colleges proclaim that those laws are
inexorable and far removed from political control.

When selfish interest seeks undue private benefits through
governmental aid, and public places are claimed as rewards of party
service, I would have our universities and colleges persuade the
people to a relinquishment of the demand for party spoils and exhort
them to a disinterested and patriotic love of their government, whose
unperverted operation secures to every citizen his just share of the
safety and prosperity it holds in store for all.

I would have the influence of these institutions on the side of
religion and morality. I would have those they send out among the
people not ashamed to acknowledge God, and to proclaim His
interposition in the affairs of men, enjoining such obedience to His
laws as makes manifest the path of national perpetuity and
prosperity

_EULOGY OF GARFIELD_

(Extract)

Great in life, he was surpassingly great in death. For no cause, in the
very frenzy of wantonness and wickedness, by the red hand of
murder, he was thrust from the full tide of this world's interest, from

its hopes, its aspirations, its victories, into the visible presence of
death—and he did not quail. Not alone for the one short moment in
which, stunned and dazed, he could give up life, hardly aware of its
relinquishment, but through days of deadly languor, through weeks
of agony, that was not less agony because silently borne, with clear
sight and calm courage, he looked into his open grave. What blight
and ruin met his anguished eyes, whose lips may tell—what
brilliant, broken plans, what baffled, high ambitions, what sundering
of strong, warm, manhood's friendships, what bitter rending of sweet
household ties! Behind him a proud, expectant nation, a great host of
sustaining friends, a cherished and happy mother, wearing the full
rich honors of her early toil and tears; the wife of his youth, whose
whole life lay in his; the little boys not yet emerged from childhood's
day of frolic; the fair young daughter; the sturdy sons just springing
into closest companionship, claiming every day and every day
rewarding a father's love and care; and in his heart the eager,
rejoicing power to meet all demand. Before him, desolation and
great darkness! And his soul was not shaken. His countrymen were
thrilled with instant, profound and universal sympathy. Masterful in
his mortal weakness, he became the centre of a nation's love,
enshrined in the prayers of a world. But all the love and all the
sympathy could not share with him his suffering. He trod the wine
press alone. With unfaltering front he faced death. With unfailing
tenderness he took leave of life. Above the demoniac hiss of the
assassin's bullet he heard the voice of God. With simple resignation
he bowed to the Divine decree.

—JAMES G. BLAINE, delivered at the memorial service held by the
U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.

_EULOGY OF LEE_

(Extract)

At the bottom of all true heroism is unselfishness. Its crowning
expression is sacrifice. The world is suspicious of vaunted heroes.
But when the true hero has come, and we know that here he is in
verity, ah! how the hearts of men leap forth to greet him! how
worshipfully we welcome God's noblest work—the strong, honest,
fearless, upright man. In Robert Lee was such a hero vouchsafed to

us and to mankind, and whether we behold him declining command
of the federal army to fight the battles and share the miseries of his
own people; proclaiming on the heights in front of Gettysburg that
the fault of the disaster was his own; leading charges in the crisis of
combat; walking under the yoke of conquest without a murmur of
complaint; or refusing fortune to come here and train the youth of
his country in the paths of duty,—he is ever the same meek, grand,
self-sacrificing spirit. Here he exhibited qualities not less worthy and
heroic than those displayed on the broad and open theater of
conflict, when the eyes of nations watched his every action. Here in
the calm repose of civil and domestic duties, and in the trying
routine of incessant tasks, he lived a life as high as when, day by
day, he marshalled and led his thin and wasting lines, and slept by
night upon the field that was to be drenched again in blood upon the
morrow. And now he has vanished from us forever. And is this all
that is left of him—this handful of dust beneath the marble stone?
No! the ages answer as they rise from the gulfs of time, where lie the
wrecks of kingdoms and estates, holding up in their hands as their
only trophies, the names of those who have wrought for man in the
love and fear of God, and in love—unfearing for their fellow-men.
No! the present answers, bending by his tomb. No! the future
answers as the breath of the morning fans its radiant brow, and its
soul drinks in sweet inspirations from the lovely life of Lee. No!
methinks the very heavens echo, as melt into their depths the words
of reverent love that voice the hearts of men to the tingling stars.

Come we then to-day in loyal love to sanctify our memories, to
purify our hopes, to make strong all good intent by communion with
the spirit of him who, being dead yet speaketh. Come, child, in thy
spotless innocence; come, woman, in thy purity; come, youth, in thy
prime; come, manhood, in thy strength; come, age, in thy ripe
wisdom; come, citizen; come, soldier; let us strew the roses and
lilies of June around his tomb, for he, like them, exhaled in his life
Nature's beneficence, and the grave has consecrated that life and
given it to us all; let us crown his tomb with the oak, the emblem of
his strength, and with the laurel the emblem of his glory, and let
these guns, whose voices he knew of old, awake the echoes of the
mountains, that nature herself may join in his solemn requiem.
Come, for here he rests, and

```
On this green bank, by this fair
stream,
We set to-day a votive stone,
That memory may his deeds
redeem?
When, like our sires, our sons are
gone.
```

```
—JOHN WARWICK DANIEL, on the unveiling of Lee's statue at
Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia, 1883.

MAKING CONVERSATION EFFECTIVE
```

```
In conversation avoid the extremes of forwardness and reserve.
```

```
—CATO.
```

```
Conversation is the laboratory and workshop of the student.
```

```
—EMERSON, Essays: Circles.
```

The father of W.E. Gladstone considered conversation to be both an art and an
accomplishment. Around the dinner table in his home some topic of local or
national interest, or some debated question, was constantly being discussed. In
this way a friendly rivalry for supremacy in conversation arose among the
family, and an incident observed in the street, an idea gleaned from a book, a
deduction from personal experience, was carefully stored as material for the
family exchange. Thus his early years of practise in elegant conversation
prepared the younger Gladstone for his career as a leader and speaker.

There is a sense in which the ability to converse effectively is efficient public
speaking, for our conversation is often heard by many, and occasionally
decisions of great moment hinge upon the tone and quality of what we say in
private.

Indeed, conversation in the aggregate probably wields more power than press
and platform combined. Socrates taught his great truths, not from public
rostrums, but in personal converse. Men made pilgrimages to Goethe's library
and Coleridge's home to be charmed and instructed by their speech, and the
culture of many nations was immeasurably influenced by the thoughts that
streamed out from those rich well-springs.

Most of the world-moving speeches are made in the course of conversation.
Conferences of diplomats, business-getting arguments, decisions by boards of
directors, considerations of corporate policy, all of which influence the political,
mercantile and economic maps of the world, are usually the results of careful
though informal conversation, and the man whose opinions weigh in such crises
is he who has first carefully pondered the words of both antagonist and
protagonist.

However important it may be to attain self-control in light social converse, or
about the family table, it is undeniably vital to have oneself perfectly in hand
while taking part in a momentous conference. Then the hints that we have given
on poise, alertness, precision of word, clearness of statement, and force of
utterance, with respect to public speech, are equally applicable to conversation.

The form of nervous egotism—for it is both—that suddenly ends in flusters just
when the vital words need to be uttered, is the sign of coming defeat, for a
conversation is often a contest. If you feel this tendency embarrassing you, be
sure to listen to Holmes's advice:

```
And when you stick on conversational burs,
Don't strew your pathway with those dreadful urs.
```

Here bring your will into action, for your trouble is a wandering attention. You
must _force_ your mind to persist along the chosen line of conversation and
resolutely refuse to be diverted by _any_ subject or happening that may
unexpectedly pop up to distract you. To fail here is to lose effectiveness utterly.

Concentration is the keynote of conversational charm and efficiency. The
haphazard habit of expression that uses bird-shot when a bullet is needed insures
missing the game, for diplomacy of all sorts rests upon the precise application of
precise words, particularly—if one may paraphrase Tallyrand—in those crises
when language is no longer used to conceal thought.

We may frequently gain new light on old subjects by looking at word-
derivations. Conversation signifies in the original a turn-about exchange of
ideas, yet most people seem to regard it as a monologue. Bronson Alcott used to
say that many could argue, but few converse. The first thing to remember in
conversation, then, is that listening—respectful, sympathetic, alert listening—is
not only due to our fellow converser but due to ourselves. Many a reply loses its
point because the speaker is so much interested in what he is about to say that it

is really no reply at all but merely an irritating and humiliating irrelevancy.

Self-expression is exhilarating. This explains the eternal impulse to decorate
totem poles and paint pictures, write poetry and expound philosophy. One of the
chief delights of conversation is the opportunity it affords for self-expression. A
good conversationalist who monopolizes all the conversation, will be voted a
bore because he denies others the enjoyment of self-expression, while a
mediocre talker who listens interestedly may be considered a good
conversationalist because he permits his companions to please themselves
through self-expression. They are praised who please: they please who listen
well.

The first step in remedying habits of confusion in manner, awkward bearing,
vagueness in thought, and lack of precision in utterance, is to recognize your
faults. If you are serenely unconscious of them, no one—least of all yourself—
can help you. But once diagnose your own weaknesses, and you can overcome
them by doing four things:

[^1]:. _WILL_ to overcome them, and keep on willing.

[^2]:. Hold yourself in hand by assuring yourself that you know precisely what you
ought to say. If you cannot do that, be quiet until you are clear on this vital point.

[^3]:. Having thus assured yourself, cast out the fear of those who listen to you—
they are only human and will respect your words if you really have something to
say and say it briefly, simply, and clearly.

[^4]:. Have the courage to study the English language until you are master of at least
its simpler forms.

_Conversational Hints_

Choose some subject that will prove of general interest to the whole group. Do
not explain the mechanism of a gas engine at an afternoon tea or the culture of
hollyhocks at a stag party.

It is not considered good taste for a man to bare his arm in public and show scars
or deformities. It is equally bad form for him to flaunt his own woes, or the
deformity of some one else's character. The public demands plays and stories
that end happily. All the world is seeking happiness. They cannot long be
interested in your ills and troubles. George Cohan made himself a millionaire
before he was thirty by writing cheerful plays. One of his rules is generally

applicable to conversation: "Always leave them laughing when you say good
bye."

Dynamite the "I" out of your conversation. Not one man in nine hundred and
seven can talk about himself without being a bore. The man who can perform
that feat can achieve marvels without talking about himself, so the eternal "I" is
not permissible even in his talk.

If you habitually build your conversation around your own interests it may prove
very tiresome to your listener. He may be thinking of bird dogs or dry fly fishing
while you are discussing the fourth dimension, or the merits of a cucumber
lotion. The charming conversationalist is prepared to talk in terms of his
listener's interest. If his listener spends his spare time investigating Guernsey
cattle or agitating social reforms, the discriminating conversationalist shapes his
remarks accordingly. Richard Washburn Child says he knows a man of mediocre
ability who can charm men much abler than himself when he discusses electric
lighting. This same man probably would bore, and be bored, if he were forced to
converse about music or Madagascar.

Avoid platitudes and hackneyed phrases. If you meet a friend from Keokuk on
State Street or on Pike's Peak, it is not necessary to observe: "How small this
world is after all!" This observation was doubtless made prior to the formation of
Pike's Peak. "This old world is getting better every day." "Fanner's wives do not
have to work as hard as formerly." "It is not so much the high cost of living as
the cost of high living." Such observations as these excite about the same degree
of admiration as is drawn out by the appearance of a [^1]:[^9]:[^0]:[^3]:-model touring car. If
you have nothing fresh or interesting you can always remain silent. How would
you like to read a newspaper that flashed out in bold headlines "Nice Weather
We Are Having," or daily gave columns to the same old material you had been
reading week after week?

BRAVE LITTLE BELGIUM
```

Delivered in Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, N.Y., October [^1]:[^8]:, [^1]:[^9]:[^1]:[^4]:.
Used by permission.

Long ago Plato made a distinction between the occasions of war and
the causes of war. The occasions of war lie upon the surface, and are
known and read of all men, while the causes of war are embedded in
racial antagonisms, in political and economic controversies.
Narrative historians portray the occasions of war; philosophic
historians, the secret and hidden causes. Thus the spark of fire that
falls is the occasion of an explosion, but the cause of the havoc is the
relation between charcoal, niter and saltpeter. The occasion of the
Civil War was the firing upon Fort Sumter. The cause was the
collision between the ideals of the Union presented by Daniel
Webster and the secession taught by Calhoun. The occasion of the
American Revolution was the Stamp Tax; the cause was the
conviction on the part of our forefathers that men who had freedom
in worship carried also the capacity for self-government. The
occasion of the French Revolution was the purchase of a diamond
necklace for Queen Marie Antoinette at a time when the treasury
was exhausted; the cause of the revolution was feudalism. Not
otherwise, the occasion of the great conflict that is now shaking our
earth was the assassination of an Austrian boy and girl, but the cause
is embedded in racial antagonisms and economic competition.

As for Russia, the cause of the war was her desire to obtain the
Bosphorus—and an open seaport, which is the prize offered for her
attack upon Germany. As for Austria, the cause of the war is her fear
of the growing power of the Balkan States, and the progressive
slicing away of her territory. As for France, the cause of the war is
the instinct of self-preservation, that resists an invading host. As for
Germany, the cause is her deep-seated conviction that every country
has a moral right to the mouth of its greatest river; unable to
compete with England, by roundabout sea routes and a Kiel Canal,
she wants to use the route that nature digged for her through the
mouth of the Rhine. As for England, the motherland is fighting to
recover her sense of security. During the Napoleonic wars the
second William Pitt explained the quadrupling of the taxes, the
increase of the navy, and the sending of an English army against
France, by the statement that justification of this proposed war is the

"Preservation of England's sense of security." Ten years ago England
lost her sense of security. Today she is not seeking to preserve, but to
recover, the lost sense of security. She proposes to do this by
destroying Germany's ironclads, demobilizing her army, wiping out
her forts, and the partition of her provinces. The occasions of the
war vary, with the color of the paper—"white" and "gray" and
"blue"—but the causes of this war are embedded in racial
antagonisms and economic and political differences.

```
WHY LITTLE BELGIUM HAS THE CENTER OF THE STAGE
```

Tonight our study concerns little Belgium, her people, and their part
in this conflict. Be the reasons what they may, this little land stands
in the center of the stage and holds the limelight. Once more David,
armed with a sling, has gone up against ten Goliaths. It is an
amazing spectacle, this, one of the smallest of the States, battling
with the largest of the giants! Belgium has a standing army of
[^4]:[^2]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: men, and Germany, with three reserves, perhaps [^7]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: or
[^8]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:. Without waiting for any assistance, this little Belgium
band went up against [^2]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:. It is as if a honey bee had decided
to attack an eagle come to loot its honeycomb. It is as if an antelope
had turned against a lion. Belgium has but [^1]:[^1]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: square miles of
land, less than the States of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and
Connecticut. Her population is [^7]:,[^5]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:, less than the single State
of New York. You could put twenty-two Belgiums in our single
State of Texas. Much of her soil is thin; her handicaps are heavy, but
the industry of her people has turned the whole land into one vast
flower and vegetable garden. The soil of Minnesota and the Dakotas
is new soil, and yet our farmers there average but fifteen bushels of
wheat to the acre. Belgium's soil has been used for centuries, but it
averages thirty-seven bushels of wheat to the acre. If we grow
twenty-four bushels of barley on an acre of ground, Belgium grows
fifty; she produces [^3]:[^0]:[^0]: bushels of potatoes, where the Maine farmer
harvests [^9]:[^0]: bushels. Belgium's average population per square mile
has risen to [^6]:[^4]:[^5]: people. If Americans practised intensive farming; if
the population of Texas were as dense as it is in Belgium—
[^1]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: of the United States, Canada and Central America
could all move to Texas, while if our entire country was as densely
populated as Belgium's, everybody in the world could live

comfortably within the limits of our country.

```
THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE
```

And yet, little Belgium has no gold or silver mines, and all the
treasures of copper and zinc and lead and anthracite and oil have
been denied her. The gold is in the heart of her people. No other land
holds a race more prudent, industrious and thrifty! It is a land where
everybody works. In the winter when the sun does not rise until half
past seven, the Belgian cottages have lights in their windows at five,
and the people are ready for an eleven-hour day. As a rule all
children work after [^1]:[^2]: years of age. The exquisite pointed lace that
has made Belgium famous, is wrought by women who fulfill the
tasks of the household fulfilled by American women, and then
begins their task upon the exquisite laces that have sent their name
and fame throughout the world. Their wages are low, their work
hard, but their life is so peaceful and prosperous that few Belgians
ever emigrate to foreign countries. Of late they have made their
education compulsory, their schools free. It is doubtful whether any
other country has made a greater success of their system of
transportation. You will pay [^5]:[^0]: cents to journey some twenty odd
miles out to Roslyn, on our Long Island railroad, but in Belgium a
commuter journeys twenty miles in to the factory and back again
every night and makes the six double daily journeys at an entire cost
of [^3]:[^7]:-[^1]:/[^2]: cents per week, less than the amount that you pay for the
journey one way for a like distance in this country. Out of this has
come Belgium's prosperity. She has the money to buy goods from
other countries, and she has the property to export to foreign lands.
Last year the United States, with its hundred millions of people,
imported less than $[^2]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:, and exported $[^2]:,[^5]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:. If
our people had been as prosperous per capita as Belgium, we would
have purchased from other countries $[^1]:[^2]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: worth of
goods and exported $[^1]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:.

So largely have we been dependent upon Belgium that many of the
engines used in digging the Panama Canal came from the Cockerill
works that produce two thousands of these engines every year in
Liege. It is often said that the Belgians have the best courts in
existence. The Supreme Court of Little Belgium has but one Justice.
Without waiting for an appeal, just as soon as a decision has been

reached by a lower Court, while the matters are still fresh in mind
and all the witnesses and facts readily obtainable, this Supreme
Justice reviews all the objections raised on either side and without a
motion from anyone passes on the decision of the inferior court. On
the other hand, the lower courts are open to an immediate settlement
of disputes between the wage earners, and newsboys and fishermen
are almost daily seen going to the judge for a decision regarding a
dispute over five or ten cents. When the judge has cross-questioned
both sides, without the presence of attorneys, or the necessity of
serving a process, or raising a dollar and a quarter, as here, the
poorest of the poor have their wrongs righted. It is said that not one
decision out of one hundred is appealed, thus calling for the
existence of an attorney.

To all other institutions organized in the interest of the wage earner
has been added the national savings bank system, that makes loans
to men of small means, that enables the farmer and the working man
to buy a little garden and build a house, while at the same time
insuring the working man against accident and sickness. Belgium is
a poor man's country, it has been said, because institutions have been
administered in the interest of the men of small affairs.

```
THE GREAT BELGIUM PLAIN IN HISTORY
```

But the institutions of Belgium and the industrial prosperity of her
people alone are not equal to the explanation of her unique heroism.
Long ago, in his Commentaries, Julius Cæsar said that Gaul was
inhabited by three tribes, the Belgæ, the Aquitani, the Celts, "of
whom the Belgæ were the bravest." History will show that Belgians
have courage as their native right, for only the brave could have
survived. The southeastern part of Belgium is a series of rock plains,
and if these plains have been her good fortune in times of peace,
they have furnished the battlefields of Western Europe for two
thousand years. Northern France and Western Germany are rough,
jagged and wooded, but the Belgian plains were ideal battlefields.
For this reason the generals of Germany and of France have usually
met and struggled for the mastery on these wide Belgian plains. On
one of these grounds Julius Cæsar won the first battle that is
recorded. Then came King Clovis and the French, with their
campaigns; toward these plains also the Saracens were hurrying

when assaulted by Charles Martel. On the Belgian plains the Dutch
burghers and the Spanish armies, led by Bloody Alva, fought out
their battle. Hither, too, came Napoleon, and the great mound of
Waterloo is the monument to the Duke of Wellington's victory. It
was to the Belgian plains, also, that the German general, last August,
rushed his troops. Every college and every city searches for some
level spot of land where the contest between opposing teams may be
held, and for more than two thousand years the Belgian plain has
been the scene of the great battles between the warring nations of
Western Europe.

Now, out of all these collisions there has come a hardy race, inured
to peril, rich in fortitude, loyalty, patience, thrift, self-reliance and
persevering faith. For five hundred years the Belgian children and
youth have been brought up upon the deeds of noble renown,
achieved by their ancestors. If Julius Cæsar were here today he
would wear Belgium's bravery like a bright sword, girded to his
thigh. And when this brave little people, with a standing army of
forty-two thousand men, single-handed defied two millions of
Germans, it tells us that Ajax has come back once more to defy the
god of lightnings.

```
A THRILLING CHAPTER FROM BELGIUM'S HISTORY
```

Perhaps one or two chapters torn from the pages of Belgium history
will enable us to understand her present-day heroism, just as one
golden bough plucked from the forest will explain the richness of the
autumn. You remember that Venice was once the financial center of
the world. Then when the bankers lost confidence in the navy of
Venice they put their jewels and gold into saddle bags and moved
the financial center of the world to Nuremburg, because its walls
were seven feet thick and twenty feet high. Later, about [^1]:[^5]:[^0]:[^0]: A.D.,
the discovery of the New World turned all the peoples into races of
sea-going folk, and the English and Dutch captains vied with the
sailors of Spain and Portugal. No captains were more prosperous
than the mariners of Antwerp. In [^1]:[^5]:[^6]:[^8]: there were [^5]:[^0]:[^0]: marble
mansions in this city on the Meuse. Belgium became a casket filled
with jewels. Then it was that Spain turned covetous eyes northward.
Sated with his pleasures, broken by indulgence and passion, the
Emperor Charles the Fifth resigned his gold and throne to his son,

King Philip. Finding his coffers depleted, Philip sent the Duke of
Alva, with [^1]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: Spanish soldiers, out on a looting expedition.
Their approach filled Antwerp with consternation, for her merchants
were busy with commerce and not with war. The sack of Antwerp by
the Spaniards makes up a revolting page in history. Within three
days [^8]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: men, women and children were massacred, and the
Spanish soldiers, drunk with wine and blood, hacked, drowned and
burned like fiends that they were. The Belgian historian tells us that
[^5]:[^0]:[^0]: marble residences were reduced to blackened ruins. One
incident will make the event stand out. When the Spaniards
approached the city a wealthy burgher hastened the day of his son's
marriage. During the ceremony the soldiers broke down the gate of
the city and crossed the threshold of the rich man's house. When
they had stripped the guests of their purses and gems, unsatisfied,
they killed the bridegroom, slew the men, and carried the bride out
into the night. The next morning a young woman, crazed and half
clad, was found in the street, searching among the dead bodies. At
last she found a youth, whose head she lifted upon her knees, over
which she crooned her songs, as a young mother soothes her babe. A
Spanish officer passing by, humiliated by the spectacle, ordered a
soldier to use his dagger and put the girl out of her misery.

```
THE HORRORS OF THE INQUISITION
```

Having looted Antwerp, the treasure chest of Belgium, the Spaniards
set up the Inquisition as an organized means of securing property. It
is a strange fact that the Spaniard has excelled in cruelty as other
nations have excelled in art or science or invention. Spain's cruelty
to the Moors and the rich Jews forms one of the blackest chapters in
history. Inquisitors became fiends. Moors were starved, tortured,
burned, flung in wells, Jewish bankers had their tongues thrust
through little iron rings; then the end of the tongue was seared that it
might swell, and the banker was led by a string in the ring through
the streets of the city. The women and the children were put on rafts
that were pushed out into the Mediterranean Sea. When the swollen
corpses drifted ashore, the plague broke out, and when that black
plague spread over Spain it seemed like the justice of outraged
nature. The expulsion of the Moors was one of the deadliest blows
ever struck at science, commerce, art and literature. The historian

tracks Spain across the continents by a trail of blood. Wherever
Spain's hand has fallen it has paralyzed. From the days of Cortez,
wherever her captains have given a pledge, the tongue that spake has
been mildewed with lies and treachery. The wildest beasts are not in
the jungle; man is the lion that rends, man is the leopard that tears,
man's hate is the serpent that poisons, and the Spaniard entered
Belgium to turn a garden into a wilderness. Within one year, [^1]:[^5]:[^6]:[^8]:,
Antwerp, that began with [^1]:[^2]:[^5]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: people, ended it with [^5]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:.
Many multitudes were put to death by the sword and stake, but
many, many thousands fled to England, to begin anew their lives as
manufacturers and mariners; and for years Belgium was one quaking
peril, an inferno, whose torturers were Spaniards. The visitor in
Antwerp is still shown the rack upon which they stretched the
merchants that they might yield up their hidden gold. The Painted
Lady may be seen. Opening her arms, she embraces the victim. The
Spaniard, with his spear, forced the merchant into the deadly
embrace. As the iron arms concealed in velvet folded together, one
spike passed through each eye, another through the mouth, another
through the heart. The Painted Lady's lips were poisoned, so that a
kiss was fatal. The dungeon whose sides were forced together by
screws, so that each day the victim saw his cell growing less and
less, and knew that soon he would be crushed to death, was another
instrument of torture. Literally thousands of innocent men and
women were burned alive in the market place.

There is no more piteous tragedy in history than the story of the
decline and ruin of this superbly prosperous, literary and artistic
country, and yet out of the ashes came new courage. Burned, broken,
the Belgians and the Dutch were not beaten. Pushed at last into
Holland, where they united their fortunes with the Dutch, they cut
the dykes of Holland, and let in the ocean, and clinging to the dykes
with their finger tips, fought their way back to the land; but no
sooner had the last of the Spaniards gone than out of their rags and
poverty they founded a university as a monument to the providence
of God in delivering them out of the hands of their enemies. For, the
Sixteenth Century, in the form of a brave knight, wears little
Belgium and Holland like a red rose upon his heart.

```
THE DEATH OF EGMONT
```

But some of you will say that the Belgian people must have been
rebels and guilty of some excess, and that had they remained
quiescent, and not fomented treason, that no such fate could have
overtaken them at the hands of Spain. Very well. I will take a youth
who, at the beginning, believed in Charles the Fifth, a man who was
as true to his ideals as the needle to the pole. One day the "Bloody
Council" decreed the death of Egmont and Horn. Immediately
afterward, the Duke of Alva sent an invitation to Egmont to be the
guest of honor at a banquet in his own house. A servant from the
palace that night delivered to the Count a slip of paper, containing a
warning to take the fleetest horse and flee the city, and from that
moment not to eat or sleep without pistols at his hand. To all this
Egmont responded that no monster ever lived who could, with an
invitation of hospitality, trick a patriot. Like a brave man, the Count
went to the Duke's palace. He found the guests assembled, but when
he had handed his hat and cloak to the servant, Alva gave a sign, and
from behind the curtains came Spanish musqueteers, who demanded
his sword. For instead of a banquet hall, the Count was taken to a
cellar, fitted up as a dungeon. Already Egmont had all but died for
his country. He had used his ships, his trade, his gold, for righting
the people's wrongs. He was a man of a large family—a wife and
eleven children—and people loved him as to idolatry. But Alva was
inexorable. He had made up his mind that the merchants and
burghers had still much hidden gold, and if he killed their bravest
and best, terror would fall upon all alike, and that the gold he needed
would be forthcoming. That all the people might witness the scene,
he took his prisoners to Brussels and decided to behead them in the
public square. In the evening Egmont received the notice that his
head would be chopped off the next day. A scaffold was erected in
the public square. That evening he wrote a letter that is a marvel of
restraint.

"Sire—I have learned this evening the sentence which your majesty
has been pleased to pronounce upon me. Although I have never had
a thought, and believe myself never to have done a deed, which
would tend to the prejudice of your service, or to the detriment of
true religion, nevertheless I take patience to bear that which it has
pleased the good God to permit. Therefore, I pray your majesty to
have compassion on my poor wife, my children and my servants,

having regard to my past service. In which hope I now commend
myself to the mercy of God. From Brussels, ready to die, this [^5]:th of
June, [^1]:[^5]:[^6]:[^8]:.

```
"LAMORAL D' EGMONT."
```

Thus died a man who did as much probably for Holland as John
Eliot for England, or Lafayette for France, or Samuel Adams for this
young republic.

```
THE WOE OF BELGIUM
```

And now out of all this glorious past comes the woe of Belgium.
Desolation has come like the whirlwind, and destruction like a
tornado. But ninety days ago and Belgium was a hive of industry,
and in the fields were heard the harvest songs. Suddenly, Germany
struck Belgium. The whole world has but one voice, "Belgium has
innocent hands." She was led like a lamb to the slaughter. When the
lover of Germany is asked to explain Germany's breaking of her
solemn treaty upon the neutrality of Belgium, the German stands
dumb and speechless. Merchants honor their written obligations.
True citizens consider their word as good as their bond; Germany
gave treaty, and in the presence of God and the civilized world,
entered into a solemn covenant with Belgium. To the end of time,
the German must expect this taunt, "as worthless as a German
treaty." Scarcely less black the two or three known examples of
cruelty wrought upon nonresisting Belgians. In Brooklyn lives a
Belgian woman. She planned to return home in late July to visit a
father who had suffered paralysis, an aged mother and a sister who
nursed both. When the Germans decided to burn that village in
Eastern Belgium, they did not wish to burn alive this old and
helpless man, so they bayonetted to death the old man and woman,
and the daughter that nursed them.

Let us judge not, that we be not judged. This is the one example of
atrocity that you and I might be able personally to prove. But every
loyal German in the country can make answer: "These soldiers were
drunk with wine and blood. Such an atrocity misrepresents Germany
and her soldiers. The breaking of Germany's treaty with Belgium
represents the dishonor of a military ring, and not the perfidy of

[^6]:[^8]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: of people. We ask that judgment be postponed until all
the facts are in." But, meanwhile, the man who loves his fellows, at
midnight in his dreams walks across the fields of broken Belgium.
All through the night air there comes the sob of Rachel, weeping for
her children, because they are not. In moods of bitterness, of doubt
and despair the heart cries out, "How could a just God permit such
cruelty upon innocent Belgium?" No man knows. "Clouds and
darkness are round about God's throne." The spirit of evil caused
this war, but the Spirit of God may bring good out of it, just as the
summer can repair the ravages of winter. Meanwhile the heart bleeds
for Belgium. For Brussels, the third most beautiful city in Europe!
For Louvain, once rich with its libraries, cathedrals, statues,
paintings, missals, manuscripts—now a ruin. Alas! for the ruined
harvests and the smoking villages! Alas, for the Cathedral that is a
heap, and the library that is a ruin. Where the angel of happiness was
there stalk Famine and Death. Gone, the Land of Grotius! Perished
the paintings of Rubens! Ruined is Louvain. Where the wheat
waved, now the hillsides are billowy with graves. But let us believe
that God reigns. Perchance Belgium is slain like the Saviour, that
militarism may die like Satan. Without shedding of innocent blood
there is no remission of sins through tyranny and greed. There is no
wine without the crushing of the grapes from the tree of life. Soon
Liberty, God's dear child, will stand within the scene and comfort the
desolate. Falling upon the great world's altar stairs, in this hour when
wisdom is ignorance, and the strongest man clutches at dust and
straw, let us believe with faith victorious over tears, that some time
God will gather broken-hearted little Belgium into His arms and
comfort her as a Father comforteth his well-beloved child.

THE NEW AMERICANISM
```

```
(Abridged)
```

Eight years ago tonight, there stood where I am standing now a
young Georgian, who, not without reason, recognized the
"significance" of his presence here, and, in words whose eloquence I
cannot hope to recall, appealed from the New South to New England

for a united country.

He is gone now. But, short as his life was, its heaven-born mission
was fulfilled; the dream of his childhood was realized; for he had
been appointed by God to carry a message of peace on earth, good
will to men, and, this done, he vanished from the sight of mortal
eyes, even as the dove from the ark.

Grady told us, and told us truly, of that typical American who, in Dr.
Talmage's mind's eye, was coming, but who, in Abraham Lincoln's
actuality, had already come. In some recent studies into the career of
that man, I have encountered many startling confirmations of this
judgment; and from that rugged trunk, drawing its sustenance from
gnarled roots, interlocked with Cavalier sprays and Puritan branches
deep beneath the soil, shall spring, is springing, a shapely tree—
symmetric in all its parts—under whose sheltering boughs this
nation shall have the new birth of freedom Lincoln promised it, and
mankind the refuge which was sought by the forefathers when they
fled from oppression. Thank God, the ax, the gibbet, and the stake
have had their day. They have gone, let us hope, to keep company
with the lost arts. It has been demonstrated that great wrongs may be
redressed and great reforms be achieved without the shedding of one
drop of human blood; that vengeance does not purify, but brutalizes;
and that tolerance, which in private transactions is reckoned a virtue,
becomes in public affairs a dogma of the most far-seeing
statesmanship.

So I appeal from the men in silken hose who danced to music made
by slaves—and called it freedom—from the men in bell-crowned
hats, who led _Hester Prynne_ to her shame—and called it religion—
to that Americanism which reaches forth its arms to smite wrong
with reason and truth, secure in the power of both. I appeal from the
patriarchs of New England to the poets of New England; from
Endicott to Lowell; from Winthrop to Longfellow; from Norton to
Holmes; and I appeal in the name and by the rights of that common
citizenship—of that common origin—back of both the Puritan and
the Cavalier—to which all of us owe our being. Let the dead past,
consecrated by the blood of its martyrs, not by its savage hatreds—
darkened alike by kingcraft and priestcraft—let the dead past bury
its dead. Let the present and the future ring with the song of the

singers. Blessed be the lessons they teach, the laws they make.
Blessed be the eye to see, the light to reveal. Blessed be Tolerance,
sitting ever on the right hand of God to guide the way with loving
word, as blessed be all that brings us nearer the goal of true religion,
true Republicanism, and true patriotism, distrust of watchwords and
labels, shams and heroes, belief in our country and ourselves. It was
not Cotton Mather, but John Greenleaf Whittier, who cried:—

```
"Dear God and Father of us all,
Forgive our faith in cruel lies,
Forgive the blindness that denies.
```

```
"Cast down our idols—overturn
Our bloody altars—make us see
Thyself in Thy humanity!"

FOUNDER'S DAY ADDRESS
```

```
(Abridged)
```

Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, Pa., November [^3]:, [^1]:[^9]:[^0]:[^4]:.

What is so hard as a just estimate of the events of our own time? It is
only now, a century and a half later, that we really perceive that a
writer has something to say for himself when he calls Wolfe's exploit
at Quebec the turning point in modern history. And to-day it is hard
to imagine any rational standard that would not make the American
Revolution—an insurrection of thirteen little colonies, with a
population of [^3]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: scattered in a distant wilderness among
savages—a mightier event in many of its aspects than the volcanic
convulsion in France. Again, the upbuilding of your great West on
this continent is reckoned by some the most important world
movement of the last hundred years. But is it more important than
the amazing, imposing and perhaps disquieting apparition of Japan?
One authority insists that when Russia descended into the Far East
and pushed her frontier on the Pacific to the forty-third degree of
latitude that was one of the most far-reaching facts of modern

history, tho it almost escaped the eyes of Europe—all her
perceptions then monopolized by affairs in the Levant. Who can
say? Many courses of the sun were needed before men could take
the full historic measures of Luther, Calvin, Knox; the measure of
Loyola, the Council of Trent, and all the counter-reformation. The
center of gravity is forever shifting, the political axis of the world
perpetually changing. But we are now far enough off to discern how
stupendous a thing was done when, after two cycles of bitter war,
one foreign, the other civil and intestine, Pitt and Washington, within
a span of less than a score of years, planted the foundations of the
American Republic.

What Forbes's stockade at Fort Pitt has grown to be you know better
than I. The huge triumphs of Pittsburg in material production—iron,
steel, coke, glass, and all the rest of it—can only be told in colossal
figures that are almost as hard to realize in our minds as the figures
of astronomical distance or geologic time. It is not quite clear that all
the founders of the Commonwealth would have surveyed the
wonderful scene with the same exultation as their descendants.
Some of them would have denied that these great centers of
industrial democracy either in the Old World or in the New always
stand for progress. Jefferson said, "I view great cities as pestilential
to the morals, the health, and the liberties of man. I consider the
class of artificers," he went on, "as the panders of vice, and the
instrument by which the liberties of a country are generally
overthrown." In England they reckon [^7]:[^0]: per cent. of our population
as dwellers in towns. With you, I read that only [^2]:[^5]: per cent. of the
population live in groups so large as [^4]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: persons. If Jefferson was
right our outlook would be dark. Let us hope that he was wrong, and
in fact toward the end of his time qualified his early view. Franklin,
at any rate, would, I feel sure, have reveled in it all.

That great man—a name in the forefront among the practical
intelligences of human history—once told a friend that when he
dwelt upon the rapid progress that mankind was making in politics,
morals, and the arts of living, and when he considered that each one
improvement always begets another, he felt assured that the future
progress of the race was likely to be quicker than it had ever been.
He was never wearied of foretelling inventions yet to come, and he

wished he could revisit the earth at the end of a century to see how
mankind was getting on. With all my heart I share his wish. Of all
the men who have built up great States, I do believe there is not one
whose alacrity of sound sense and single-eyed beneficence of aim
could be more safely trusted than Franklin to draw light from the
clouds and pierce the economic and political confusions of our time.
We can imagine the amazement and complacency of that shrewd
benignant mind if he could watch all the giant marvels of your mills
and furnaces, and all the apparatus devised by the wondrous
inventive faculties of man; if he could have foreseen that his
experiments with the kite in his garden at Philadelphia, his tubes, his
Leyden jars would end in the electric appliances of to-day—the
largest electric plant in all the world on the site of Fort Duquesne; if
he could have heard of [^5]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: of passengers carried in the
United States by electric motor power in a year; if he could have
realized all the rest of the magician's tale of our time.

Still more would he have been astounded and elated could he have
foreseen, beyond all advances in material production, the unbroken
strength of that political structure which he had so grand a share in
rearing. Into this very region where we are this afternoon, swept
wave after wave of immigration; English from Virginia flowed over
the border, bringing English traits, literature, habits of mind; Scots,
or Scots-Irish, originally from Ulster, flowed in from Central
Pennsylvania; Catholics from Southern Ireland; new hosts from
Southern and East Central Europe. This is not the Fourth of July. But
people of every school would agree that it is no exuberance of
rhetoric, it is only sober truth to say that the persevering absorption
and incorporation of all this ceaseless torrent of heterogenous
elements into one united, stable, industrious, and pacific State is an
achievement that neither the Roman Empire nor the Roman Church,
neither Byzantine Empire nor Russian, not Charles the Great nor
Charles the Fifth nor Napoleon ever rivaled or approached.

We are usually apt to excuse the slower rate of liberal progress in
our Old World by contrasting the obstructive barriers of prejudice,
survival, solecism, anachronism, convention, institution, all so
obstinately rooted, even when the branches seem bare and broken, in
an old world, with the open and disengaged ground of the new. Yet

in fact your difficulties were at least as formidable as those of the
older civilizations into whose fruitful heritage you have entered.
Unique was the necessity of this gigantic task of incorporation, the
assimilation of people of divers faiths and race. A second difficulty
was more formidable still—how to erect and work a powerful and
wealthy State on such a system as to combine the centralized concert
of a federal system with local independence, and to unite collective
energy with the encouragement of individual freedom.

This last difficulty that you have so successfully up to now
surmounted, at the present hour confronts the mother country and
deeply perplexes her statesmen. Liberty and union have been called
the twin ideas of America. So, too, they are the twin ideals of all
responsible men in Great Britain; altho responsible men differ
among themselves as to the safest path on which to travel toward the
common goal, and tho the dividing ocean, in other ways so much
our friend, interposes, for our case of an island State, or rather for a
group of island States, obstacles from which a continental State like
yours is happily altogether free.

Nobody believes that no difficulties remain. Some of them are
obvious. But the common-sense, the mixture of patience and
determination that has conquered risks and mischiefs in the past,
may be trusted with the future.

Strange and devious are the paths of history. Broad and shining
channels get mysteriously silted up. How many a time what seemed
a glorious high road proves no more than a mule track or mere cul-
de-sac. Think of Canning's flashing boast, when he insisted on the
recognition of the Spanish republics in South America—that he had
called a new world into existence to redress the balance of the old.
This is one of the sayings—of which sort many another might be
found—that make the fortune of a rhetorician, yet stand ill the wear
and tear of time and circumstance. The new world that Canning
called into existence has so far turned out a scene of singular
disenchantment.

Tho not without glimpses on occasion of that heroism and courage
and even wisdom that are the attributes of man almost at the worst,
the tale has been too much a tale of anarchy and disaster, still

leaving a host of perplexities for statesmen both in America and
Europe. It has left also to students of a philosophic turn of mind one
of the most interesting of all the problems to be found in the whole
field of social, ecclesiastical, religious, and racial movement. Why is
it that we do not find in the south as we find in the north of this
hemisphere a powerful federation—a great Spanish-American
people stretching from the Rio Grande to Cape Horn? To answer that
question would be to shed a flood of light upon many deep historic
forces in the Old World, of which, after all, these movements of the
New are but a prolongation and more manifest extension.

What more imposing phenomenon does history present to us than
the rise of Spanish power to the pinnacle of greatness and glory in
the sixteenth century? The Mohammedans, after centuries of fierce
and stubborn war, driven back; the whole peninsula brought under a
single rule with a single creed; enormous acquisitions from the
Netherlands of Naples, Sicily, the Canaries; France humbled,
England menaced, settlements made in Asia and Northern Africa—
Spain in America become possessed of a vast continent and of more
than one archipelago of splendid islands. Yet before a century was
over the sovereign majesty of Spain underwent a huge declension,
the territory under her sway was contracted, the fabulous wealth of
the mines of the New World had been wasted, agriculture and
industry were ruined, her commerce passed into the hands of her
rivals.

Let me digress one further moment. We have a very sensible habit in
the island whence I come, when our country misses fire, to say as
little as we can, and sink the thing in patriotic oblivion. It is rather
startling to recall that less than a century ago England twice sent a
military force to seize what is now Argentina. Pride of race and
hostile creed vehemently resisting, proved too much for us. The two
expeditions ended in failure, and nothing remains for the historian of
to-day but to wonder what a difference it might have made to the
temperate region of South America if the fortune of war had gone
the other way, if the region of the Plata had become British, and a
large British immigration had followed. Do not think me guilty of
the heinous crime of forgetting the Monroe Doctrine. That
momentous declaration was not made for a good many years after

our Gen. Whitelocke was repulsed at Buenos Ayres, tho Mr. Sumner
and other people have always held that it was Canning who really
first started the Monroe Doctrine, when he invited the United States
to join him against European intervention in South American affairs.

The day is at hand, we are told, when four-fifths of the human race
will trace their pedigree to English forefathers, as four-fifths of the
white people in the United States trace their pedigree to-day. By the
end of this century, they say, such nations as France and Germany,
assuming that they stand apart from fresh consolidations, will only
be able to claim the same relative position in the political world as
Holland and Switzerland. These musings of the moon do not take us
far. The important thing, as we all know, is not the exact fraction of
the human race that will speak English. The important thing is that
those who speak English, whether in old lands or new, shall strive in
lofty, generous and never-ceasing emulation with peoples of other
tongues and other stock for the political, social, and intellectual
primacy among mankind. In this noble strife for the service of our
race we need never fear that claimants for the prize will be too large
a multitude.

As an able scholar of your own has said, Jefferson was here using
the old vernacular of English aspirations after a free, manly, and
well-ordered political life—a vernacular rich in stately tradition and
noble phrase, to be found in a score of a thousand of champions in
many camps—in Buchanan, Milton, Hooker, Locke, Jeremy Taylor,
Roger Williams, and many another humbler but not less strenuous
pioneer and confessor of freedom. Ah, do not fail to count up, and
count up often, what a different world it would have been but for
that island in the distant northern sea! These were the tributary
fountains, that, as time went on, swelled into the broad confluence of
modern time. What was new in [^1]:[^7]:[^7]:[^6]: was the transformation of
thought into actual polity.

What is progress? It is best to be slow in the complex arts of politics
in their widest sense, and not to hurry to define. If you want a
platitude, there is nothing for supplying it like a definition. Or shall
we say that most definitions hang between platitude and paradox?
There are said, tho I have never counted, to be [^1]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: definitions of
religion. There must be about as many of poetry. There can hardly

be fewer of liberty, or even of happiness.

I am not bold enough to try a definition. I will not try to gauge how
far the advance of moral forces has kept pace with that extension of
material forces in the world of which this continent, conspicuous
before all others, bears such astounding evidence. This, of course, is
the question of questions, because as an illustrious English writer—
to whom, by the way, I owe my friendship with your founder many
long years ago—as Matthew Arnold said in America here, it is
moral ideas that at bottom decide the standing or falling of states and
nations. Without opening this vast discussion at large, many a sign
of progress is beyond mistake. The practise of associated action—
one of the master keys of progress—is a new force in a hundred
fields, and with immeasurable diversity of forms. There is less
acquiescence in triumphant wrong. Toleration in religion has been
called the best fruit of the last four centuries, and in spite of a few
bigoted survivals, even in our United Kingdom, and some savage
outbreaks of hatred, half religious, half racial, on the Continent of
Europe, this glorious gain of time may now be taken as secured.
Perhaps of all the contributions of America to human civilization
this is greatest. The reign of force is not yet over, and at intervals it
has its triumphant hours, but reason, justice, humanity fight with
success their long and steady battle for a wider sway.

Of all the points of social advance, in my country at least, during the
last generation none is more marked than the change in the position
of women, in respect of rights of property, of education, of access to
new callings. As for the improvement of material well-being, and its
diffusion among those whose labor is a prime factor in its creation,
we might grow sated with the jubilant monotony of its figures, if we
did not take good care to remember, in the excellent words of the
President of Harvard, that those gains, like the prosperous working
of your institutions and the principles by which they are sustained,
are in essence moral contributions, "being principles of reason,
enterprise, courage, faith, and justice, over passion, selfishness,
inertness, timidity, and distrust." It is the moral impulses that matter.
Where they are safe, all is safe.

When this and the like is said, nobody supposes that the last word
has been spoken as to the condition of the people either in America

or Europe. Republicanism is not itself a panacea for economic
difficulties. Of self it can neither stifle nor appease the accents of
social discontent. So long as it has no root in surveyed envy, this
discontent itself is a token of progress.

What, cries the skeptic, what has become of all the hopes of the time
when France stood upon the top of golden hours? Do not let us fear
the challenge. Much has come of them. And over the old hopes time
has brought a stratum of new.

Liberalism is sometimes suspected of being cold to these new hopes,
and you may often hear it said that Liberalism is already superseded
by Socialism. That a change is passing over party names in Europe
is plain, but you may be sure that no change in name will extinguish
these principles of society which are rooted in the nature of things,
and are accredited by their success. Twice America has saved
liberalism in Great Britain. The War for Independence in the
eighteenth century was the defeat of usurping power no less in
England than here. The War for Union in the nineteenth century
gave the decisive impulse to a critical extension of suffrage, and an
era of popular reform in the mother country. Any miscarriage of
democracy here reacts against progress in Great Britain.

If you seek the real meaning of most modern disparagement of
popular or parliamentary government, it is no more than this, that no
politics will suffice of themselves to make a nation's soul. What
could be more true? Who says it will? But we may depend upon it
that the soul will be best kept alive in a nation where there is the
highest proportion of those who, in the phrase of an old worthy of
the seventeenth century, think it a part of a man's religion to see to it
that his country be well governed.

Democracy, they tell us, is afflicted by mediocrity and by sterility.
But has not democracy in my country, as in yours, shown before
now that it well knows how to choose rulers neither mediocre nor
sterile; men more than the equals in unselfishness, in rectitude, in
clear sight, in force, of any absolutist statesman, that ever in times
past bore the scepter? If I live a few months, or it may be even a few
weeks longer, I hope to have seen something of three elections—one
in Canada, one in the United Kingdom, and the other here. With us,

in respect of leadership, and apart from height of social prestige, the
personage corresponding to the president is, as you know, the prime
minister. Our general election this time, owing to personal accident
of the passing hour, may not determine quite exactly who shall be
the prime minister, but it will determine the party from which the
prime minister shall be taken. On normal occasions our election of a
prime minister is as direct and personal as yours, and in choosing a
member of Parliament people were really for a whole generation
choosing whether Disraeli or Gladstone or Salisbury should be head
of the government.

The one central difference between your system and ours is that the
American president is in for a fixed time, whereas the British prime
minister depends upon the support of the House of Commons. If he
loses that, his power may not endure a twelvemonth; if on the other
hand, he keeps it, he may hold office for a dozen years. There are
not many more interesting or important questions in political
discussion than the question whether our cabinet government or your
presidential system of government is the better. This is not the place
to argue it.

Between [^1]:[^8]:[^6]:[^8]: and now—a period of thirty-six years—we have had
eight ministries. This would give an average life of four and a half
years. Of these eight governments five lasted over five years.
Broadly speaking, then, our executive governments have lasted
about the length of your fixed term. As for ministers swept away by
a gust of passion, I can only recall the overthrow of Lord Palmerston
in [^1]:[^8]:[^5]:[^8]: for being thought too subservient to France. For my own
part, I have always thought that by its free play, its comparative
fluidity, its rapid flexibility of adaptation, our cabinet system has
most to say for itself.

Whether democracy will make for peace, we all have yet to see. So
far democracy has done little in Europe to protect us against the
turbid whirlpools of a military age. When the evils of rival states,
antagonistic races, territorial claims, and all the other formulas of
international conflict are felt to be unbearable and the curse becomes
too great to be any longer borne, a school of teachers will perhaps
arise to pick up again the thread of the best writers and wisest rulers
on the eve of the revolution. Movement in this region of human

things has not all been progressive. If we survey the European courts
from the end of the Seven Years' War down to the French
Revolution, we note the marked growth of a distinctly international
and pacific spirit. At no era in the world's history can we find so
many European statesmen after peace and the good government of
which peace is the best ally. That sentiment came to violent end
when Napoleon arose to scourge the world.

ON RESIGNING FROM THE SENATE, 1861
```

```
(Abridged)
```

The success of the Abolitionists and their allies, under the name of
the Republican party, has produced its logical results already. They
have for long years been sowing dragons' teeth and have finally got
a crop of armed men. The Union, sir, is dissolved. That is an
accomplished fact in the path of this discussion that men may as
well heed. One of your confederates has already wisely, bravely,
boldly confronted public danger, and she is only ahead of many of
her sisters because of her greater facility for speedy action. The
greater majority of those sister States, under like circumstances,
consider her cause as their cause; and I charge you in their name to-

day: "Touch not Saguntum."[[^3][^7]] It is not only their cause, but it is a
cause which receives the sympathy and will receive the support of
tens and hundreds of honest patriot men in the nonslaveholding
States, who have hitherto maintained constitutional rights, and who
respect their oaths, abide by compacts, and love justice.

And while this Congress, this Senate, and this House of
Representatives are debating the constitutionality and the
expediency of seceding from the Union, and while the perfidious
authors of this mischief are showering down denunciations upon a
large portion of the patriotic men of this country, those brave men
are coolly and calmly voting what you call revolution—aye, sir,
doing better than that: arming to defend it. They appealed to the
Constitution, they appealed to justice, they appealed to fraternity,
until the Constitution, justice, and fraternity were no longer listened

to in the legislative halls of their country, and then, sir, they prepared
for the arbitrament of the sword; and now you see the glittering
bayonet, and you hear the tramp of armed men from your capitol to
the Rio Grande. It is a sight that gladdens the eyes and cheers the
hearts of other millions ready to second them. Inasmuch, sir, as I
have labored earnestly, honestly, sincerely, with these men to avert
this necessity so long as I deemed it possible, and inasmuch as I
heartily approve their present conduct of resistance, I deem it my
duty to state their case to the Senate, to the country, and to the
civilized world.

Senators, my countrymen have demanded no new government; they
have demanded no new Constitution. Look to their records at home
and here from the beginning of this national strife until its
consummation in the disruption of the empire, and they have not
demanded a single thing except that you shall abide by the
Constitution of the United States; that constitutional rights shall be
respected, and that justice shall be done. Sirs, they have stood by
your Constitution; they have stood by all its requirements, they have
performed all its duties unselfishly, uncalculatingly, disinterestedly,
until a party sprang up in this country which endangered their social
system—a party which they arraign, and which they charge before
the American people and all mankind with having made
proclamation of outlawry against four thousand millions of their
property in the Territories of the United States; with having put them
under the ban of the empire in all the States in which their
institutions exist outside the protection of federal laws; with having
aided and abetted insurrection from within and invasion from
without with the view of subverting those institutions, and
desolating their homes and their firesides. For these causes they have
taken up arms.

I have stated that the discontented States of this Union have
demanded nothing but clear, distinct, unequivocal, well-
acknowledged constitutional rights—rights affirmed by the highest
judicial tribunals of their country; rights older than the Constitution;
rights which are planted upon the immutable principles of natural
justice; rights which have been affirmed by the good and the wise of
all countries, and of all centuries. We demand no power to injure any

man. We demand no right to injure our confederate States. We
demand no right to interfere with their institutions, either by word or
deed. We have no right to disturb their peace, their tranquillity, their
security. We have demanded of them simply, solely—nothing else—
to give us _equality, security and tranquillity_. Give us these, and
peace restores itself. Refuse them, and take what you can get.

What do the rebels demand? First, "that the people of the United
States shall have an equal right to emigrate and settle in the present
or any future acquired Territories, with whatever property they may
possess (including slaves), and be securely protected in its peaceable
enjoyment until such Territory may be admitted as a State into the
Union, with or without slavery, as she may determine, on an equality
with all existing States." That is our Territorial demand. We have
fought for this Territory when blood was its price. We have paid for
it when gold was its price. We have not proposed to exclude you, tho
you have contributed very little of blood or money. I refer especially
to New England. We demand only to go into those Territories upon
terms of equality with you, as equals in this great Confederacy, to
enjoy the common property of the whole Union, and receive the
protection of the common government, until the Territory is capable
of coming into the Union as a sovereign State, when it may fix its
own institutions to suit itself.

The second proposition is, "that property in slaves shall be entitled
to the same protection from the government of the United States, in
all of its departments, everywhere, which the Constitution confers
the power upon it to extend to any other property, provided nothing
herein contained shall be construed to limit or restrain the right now
belonging to every State to prohibit, abolish, or establish and protect
slavery within its limits." We demand of the common government to
use its granted powers to protect our property as well as yours. For
this protection we pay as much as you do. This very property is
subject to taxation. It has been taxed by you and sold by you for
taxes.

The title to thousands and tens of thousands of slaves is derived
from the United States. We claim that the government, while the
Constitution recognizes our property for the purposes of taxation,
shall give it the same protection that it gives yours.

Ought it not to be so? You say no. Every one of you upon the
committee said no. Your senators say no. Your House of
Representatives says no. Throughout the length and breadth of your
conspiracy against the Constitution there is but one shout of no! This
recognition of this right is the price of my allegiance. Withhold it,
and you do not get my obedience. This is the philosophy of the
armed men who have sprung up in this country. Do you ask me to
support a government that will tax my property: that will plunder
me; that will demand my blood, and will not protect me? I would
rather see the population of my native State laid six feet beneath her
sod than they should support for one hour such a government.
Protection is the price of obedience everywhere, in all countries. It is
the only thing that makes government respectable. Deny it and you
can not have free subjects or citizens; you may have slaves.

We demand, in the next place, "that persons committing crimes
against slave property in one State, and fleeing to another, shall be
delivered up in the same manner as persons committing crimes
against other property, and that the laws of the State from which
such persons flee shall be the test of criminality." That is another one
of the demands of an extremist and a rebel.

But the nonslaveholding States, treacherous to their oaths and
compacts, have steadily refused, if the criminal only stole a negro
and that negro was a slave, to deliver him up. It was refused twice
on the requisition of my own State as long as twenty-two years ago.
It was refused by Kent and by Fairfield, governors of Maine, and
representing, I believe, each of the then federal parties. We appealed
then to fraternity, but we submitted; and this constitutional right has
been practically a dead letter from that day to this. The next case
came up between us and the State of New York, when the present
senior senator [Mr. Seward] was the governor of that State; and he
refused it. Why? He said it was not against the laws of New York to
steal a negro, and therefore he would not comply with the demand.
He made a similar refusal to Virginia. Yet these are our confederates;
these are our sister States! There is the bargain; there is the compact.
You have sworn to it. Both these governors swore to it. The senator
from New York swore to it. The governor of Ohio swore to it when
he was inaugurated. You can not bind them by oaths. Yet they talk to

us of treason; and I suppose they expect to whip freemen into loving
such brethren! They will have a good time in doing it!

It is natural we should want this provision of the Constitution carried
out. The Constitution says slaves are property; the Supreme Court
says so; the Constitution says so. The theft of slaves is a crime; they
are a subject-matter of felonious asportation. By the text and letter of
the Constitution you agreed to give them up. You have sworn to do
it, and you have broken your oaths. Of course, those who have done
so look out for pretexts. Nobody expected them to do otherwise. I do
not think I ever saw a perjurer, however bald and naked, who could
not invent some pretext to palliate his crime, or who could not, for
fifteen shillings, hire an Old Bailey lawyer to invent some for him.
Yet this requirement of the Constitution is another one of the
extreme demands of an extremist and a rebel.

The next stipulation is that fugitive slaves shall be surrendered under
the provisions of the Fugitive Slave Act of [^1]:[^8]:[^5]:[^0]:, without being
entitled either to a writ of habeas corpus, or trial by jury, or other
similar obstructions of legislation, in the State to which he may flee.
Here is the Constitution:

```
"No person held to service or labor in one State, under the
laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence
of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such
service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the
party to whom such service or labor may be due."
```

This language is plain, and everybody understood it the same way
for the first forty years of your government. In [^1]:[^7]:[^9]:[^3]:, in
Washington's time, an act was passed to carry out this provision. It
was adopted unanimously in the Senate of the United States, and
nearly so in the House of Representatives. Nobody then had
invented pretexts to show that the Constitution did not mean a negro
slave. It was clear; it was plain. Not only the federal courts, but all
the local courts in all the States, decided that this was a
constitutional obligation. How is it now? The North sought to evade
it; following the instincts of their natural character, they commenced
with the fraudulent fiction that fugitives were entitled to habeas
corpus, entitled to trial by jury in the State to which they fled. They
pretended to believe that our fugitive slaves were entitled to more
rights than their white citizens; perhaps they were right, they know
one another better than I do. You may charge a white man with
treason, or felony, or other crime, and you do not require any trial by
jury before he is given up; there is nothing to determine but that he
is legally charged with a crime and that he fled, and then he is to be
delivered up upon demand. White people are delivered up every day
in this way; but not slaves. Slaves, black people, you say, are entitled
to trial by jury; and in this way schemes have been invented to
defeat your plain constitutional obligations.

Senators, the Constitution is a compact. It contains all our
obligations and the duties of the federal government. I am content
and have ever been content to sustain it. While I doubt its perfection,
while I do not believe it was a good compact, and while I never saw
the day that I would have voted for it as a proposition _de novo_, yet I
am bound to it by oath and by that common prudence which would
induce men to abide by established forms rather than to rush into
unknown dangers. I have given to it, and intend to give to it,
unfaltering support and allegiance, but I choose to put that allegiance
on the true ground, not on the false idea that anybody's blood was

shed for it. I say that the Constitution is the whole compact. All the
obligations, all the chains that fetter the limbs of my people, are
nominated in the bond, and they wisely excluded any conclusion
against them, by declaring that "the powers not granted by the
Constitution to the United States, or forbidden by it to the States,
belonged to the States respectively or the people."

Now I will try it by that standard; I will subject it to that test. The
law of nature, the law of justice, would say—and it is so expounded
by the publicists—that equal rights in the common property shall be
enjoyed. Even in a monarchy the king can not prevent the subjects
from enjoying equality in the disposition of the public property.
Even in a despotic government this principle is recognized. It was
the blood and the money of the whole people (says the learned
Grotius, and say all the publicists) which acquired the public
property, and therefore it is not the property of the sovereign. This
right of equality being, then, according to justice and natural equity,
a right belonging to all States, when did we give it up? You say
Congress has a right to pass rules and regulations concerning the
Territory and other property of the United States. Very well. Does
that exclude those whose blood and money paid for it? Does
"dispose of" mean to rob the rightful owners? You must show a
better title than that, or a better sword than we have.

What, then, will you take? You will take nothing but your own
judgment; that is, you will not only judge for yourselves, not only
discard the court, discard our construction, discard the practise of the
government, but you will drive us out, simply because you will it.
Come and do it! You have sapped the foundations of society; you
have destroyed almost all hope of peace. In a compact where there is
no common arbiter, where the parties finally decide for themselves,
the sword alone at last becomes the real, if not the constitutional,
arbiter. Your party says that you will not take the decision of the
Supreme Court. You said so at Chicago; you said so in committee;
every man of you in both Houses says so. What are you going to do?
You say we shall submit to your construction. We shall do it, if you
can make us; but not otherwise, or in any other manner. That is
settled. You may call it secession, or you may call it revolution; but
there is a big fact standing before you, ready to oppose you—that

fact is, freemen with arms in their hands.

INAUGURAL ADDRESS
```

```
(1905)
```

MY FELLOW CITIZENS:—No people on earth have more cause to
be thankful than ours, and this is said reverently, in no spirit of
boastfulness in our own strength, but with gratitude to the Giver of
Good, Who has blessed us with the conditions which have enabled
us to achieve so large a measure of well-being and happiness.

To us as a people it has been granted to lay the foundations of our
national life in a new continent. We are the heirs of the ages, and yet
we have had to pay few of the penalties which in old countries are
exacted by the dead hand of a bygone civilization. We have not been
obliged to fight for our existence against any alien race; and yet our
life has called for the vigor and effort without which the manlier and
hardier virtues wither away.

Under such conditions it would be our own fault if we failed, and the
success which we have had in the past, the success which we
confidently believe the future will bring, should cause in us no
feeling of vainglory, but rather a deep and abiding realization of all
that life has offered us; a full acknowledgment of the responsibility
which is ours; and a fixed determination to show that under a free
government a mighty people can thrive best, alike as regard the
things of the body and the things of the soul.

Much has been given to us, and much will rightfully be expected
from us. We have duties to others and duties to ourselves—and we
can shirk neither. We have become a great nation, forced by the fact
of its greatness into relation to the other nations of the earth, and we
must behave as beseems a people with such responsibilities.

Toward all other nations, large and small, our attitude must be one of
cordial and sincere friendship. We must show not only in our words
but in our deeds that we are earnestly desirous of securing their good

will by acting toward them in a spirit of just and generous
recognition of all their rights.

But justice and generosity in a nation, as in an individual, count
most when shown not by the weak but by the strong. While ever
careful to refrain from wronging others, we must be no less insistent
that we are not wronged ourselves. We wish peace; but we wish the
peace of justice, the peace of righteousness. We wish it because we
think it is right, and not because we are afraid. No weak nation that
acts rightly and justly should ever have cause to fear, and no strong
power should ever be able to single us out as a subject for insolent
aggression.

Our relations with the other powers of the world are important; but
still more important are our relations among ourselves. Such growth
in wealth, in population, and in power, as a nation has seen during a
century and a quarter of its national life, is inevitably accompanied
by a like growth in the problems which are ever before every nation
that rises to greatness. Power invariably means both responsibility
and danger. Our forefathers faced certain perils which we have
outgrown. We now face other perils the very existence of which it
was impossible that they should foresee.

Modern life is both complex and intense, and the tremendous
changes wrought by the extraordinary industrial development of the
half century are felt in every fiber of our social and political being.
Never before have men tried so vast and formidable an experiment
as that of administering the affairs of a continent under the forms of
a democratic republic. The conditions which have told for our
marvelous material well-being, which have developed to a very high
degree our energy, self-reliance, and individual initiative, also have
brought the care and anxiety inseparable from the accumulation of
great wealth in industrial centers.

Upon the success of our experiment much depends—not only as
regards our own welfare, but as regards the welfare of mankind. If
we fail, the cause of free self-government throughout the world will
rock to its foundations, and therefore our responsibility is heavy, to
ourselves, to the world as it is to-day, and to the generations yet
unborn.

There is no good reason why we should fear the future, but there is
every reason why we should face it seriously, neither hiding from
ourselves the gravity of the problems before us, nor fearing to
approach these problems with the unbending, unflinching purpose to
solve them aright.

Yet after all, tho the problems are new, tho the tasks set before us
differ from the tasks set before our fathers, who founded and
preserved this Republic, the spirit in which these tasks must be
undertaken and these problems faced, if our duty is to be well done,
remains essentially unchanged. We know that self-government is
difficult. We know that no people needs such high traits of character
as that people which seeks to govern its affairs aright through the
freely expressed will of the free men who compose it.

But we have faith that we shall not prove false to memories of the
men of the mighty past. They did their work; they left us the
splendid heritage we now enjoy. We in our turn have an assured
confidence that we shall be able to leave this heritage unwasted and
enlarged to our children's children.

To do so, we must show, not merely in great crises, but in the
everyday affairs of life, the qualities of practical intelligence, of
courage, of hardihood, and endurance, and, above all, the power of
devotion to a lofty ideal, which made great the men who founded
this Republic in the days of Washington; which made great the men
who preserved this Republic in the days of Abraham Lincoln.

ON AMERICAN MOTHERHOOD[[^3][^8]]
```

```
(1905)
```

In our modern industrial civilization there are many and grave
dangers to counterbalance the splendors and the triumphs. It is not a
good thing to see cities grow at disproportionate speed relatively to
the country; for the small land owners, the men who own their little
homes, and therefore to a very large extent the men who till farms,
the men of the soil, have hitherto made the foundation of lasting
national life in every State; and, if the foundation becomes either too
weak or too narrow, the superstructure, no matter how attractive, is

in imminent danger of falling.

But far more important than the question of the occupation of our
citizens is the question of how their family life is conducted. No
matter what that occupation may be, as long as there is a real home
and as long as those who make up that home do their duty to one
another, to their neighbors and to the State, it is of minor
consequence whether the man's trade is plied in the country or in the
city, whether it calls for the work of the hands or for the work of the
head.

No piled-up wealth, no splendor of material growth, no brilliance of
artistic development, will permanently avail any people unless its
home life is healthy, unless the average man possesses honesty,
courage, common sense, and decency, unless he works hard and is
willing at need to fight hard; and unless the average woman is a
good wife, a good mother, able and willing to perform the first and
greatest duty of womanhood, able and willing to bear, and to bring
up as they should be brought up, healthy children, sound in body,
mind, and character, and numerous enough so that the race shall
increase and not decrease.

There are certain old truths which will be true as long as this world
endures, and which no amount of progress can alter. One of these is
the truth that the primary duty of the husband is to be the home-
maker, the breadwinner for his wife and children, and that the
primary duty of the woman is to be the helpmate, the housewife, and
mother. The woman should have ample educational advantages; but
save in exceptional cases the man must be, and she need not be, and
generally ought not to be, trained for a lifelong career as the family
breadwinner; and, therefore, after a certain point, the training of the
two must normally be different because the duties of the two are
normally different. This does not mean inequality of function, but it
does mean that normally there must be dissimilarity of function. On
the whole, I think the duty of the woman the more important, the
more difficult, and the more honorable of the two; on the whole I
respect the woman who does her duty even more than I respect the
man who does his.

No ordinary work done by a man is either as hard or as responsible

as the work of a woman who is bringing up a family of small
children; for upon her time and strength demands are made not only
every hour of the day but often every hour of the night. She may
have to get up night after night to take care of a sick child, and yet
must by day continue to do all her household duties as well; and if
the family means are scant she must usually enjoy even her rare
holidays taking her whole brood of children with her. The birth
pangs make all men the debtors of all women. Above all our
sympathy and regard are due to the struggling wives among those
whom Abraham Lincoln called the plain people, and whom he so
loved and trusted; for the lives of these women are often led on the
lonely heights of quiet, self-sacrificing heroism.

Just as the happiest and most honorable and most useful task that
can be set any man is to earn enough for the support of his wife and
family, for the bringing up and starting in life of his children, so the
most important, the most honorable and desirable task which can be
set any woman is to be a good and wise mother in a home marked by
self-respect and mutual forbearance, by willingness to perform duty,
and by refusal to sink into self-indulgence or avoid that which
entails effort and self-sacrifice. Of course there are exceptional men
and exceptional women who can do and ought to do much more than
this, who can lead and ought to lead great careers of outside
usefulness in addition to—not as substitutes for—their home work;
but I am not speaking of exceptions; I am speaking of the primary
duties, I am speaking of the average citizens, the average men and
women who make up the nation.

Inasmuch as I am speaking to an assemblage of mothers, I shall have
nothing whatever to say in praise of an easy life. Yours is the work
which is never ended. No mother has an easy time, the most mothers
have very hard times; and yet what true mother would barter her
experience of joy and sorrow in exchange for a life of cold
selfishness, which insists upon perpetual amusement and the
avoidance of care, and which often finds its fit dwelling place in
some flat designed to furnish with the least possible expenditure of
effort the maximum of comfort and of luxury, but in which there is
literally no place for children?

The woman who is a good wife, a good mother, is entitled to our

respect as is no one else; but she is entitled to it only because, and so
long as, she is worthy of it. Effort and self-sacrifice are the law of
worthy life for the man as for the woman; tho neither the effort nor
the self-sacrifice may be the same for the one as for the other. I do
not in the least believe in the patient Griselda type of woman, in the
woman who submits to gross and long continued ill treatment, any
more than I believe in a man who tamely submits to wrongful
aggression. No wrong-doing is so abhorrent as wrong-doing by a
man toward the wife and the children who should arouse every
tender feeling in his nature. Selfishness toward them, lack of
tenderness toward them, lack of consideration for them, above all,
brutality in any form toward them, should arouse the heartiest scorn
and indignation in every upright soul.

I believe in the woman keeping her self-respect just as I believe in
the man doing so. I believe in her rights just as much as I believe in
the man's, and indeed a little more; and I regard marriage as a
partnership, in which each partner is in honor bound to think of the
rights of the other as well as of his or her own. But I think that the
duties are even more important than the rights; and in the long run I
think that the reward is ampler and greater for duty well done, than
for the insistence upon individual rights, necessary tho this, too,
must often be. Your duty is hard, your responsibility great; but
greatest of all is your reward. I do not pity you in the least. On the
contrary, I feel respect and admiration for you.

Into the woman's keeping is committed the destiny of the
generations to come after us. In bringing up your children you
mothers must remember that while it is essential to be loving and
tender it is no less essential to be wise and firm. Foolishness and
affection must not be treated as interchangeable terms; and besides
training your sons and daughters in the softer and milder virtues, you
must seek to give them those stern and hardy qualities which in after
life they will surely need. Some children will go wrong in spite of
the best training; and some will go right even when their
surroundings are most unfortunate; nevertheless an immense amount
depends upon the family training. If you mothers through weakness
bring up your sons to be selfish and to think only of themselves, you
will be responsible for much sadness among the women who are to

be their wives in the future. If you let your daughters grow up idle,
perhaps under the mistaken impression that as you yourselves have
had to work hard they shall know only enjoyment, you are preparing
them to be useless to others and burdens to themselves. Teach boys
and girls alike that they are not to look forward to lives spent in
avoiding difficulties, but to lives spent in overcoming difficulties.
Teach them that work, for themselves and also for others, is not
curse but a blessing; seek to make them happy, to make them enjoy
life, but seek also to make them face life with the steadfast
resolution to wrest success from labor and adversity, and to do their
whole duty before God and to man. Surely she who can thus train
her sons and her daughters is thrice fortunate among women.

There are many good people who are denied the supreme blessing of
children, and for these we have the respect and sympathy always due
to those who, from no fault of their own, are denied any of the other
great blessings of life. But the man or woman who deliberately
foregoes these blessings, whether from viciousness, coldness,
shallow-heartedness, self-indulgence, or mere failure to appreciate
aright the difference between the all-important and the unimportant,
—why, such a creature merits contempt as hearty as any visited
upon the soldier who runs away in battle, or upon the man who
refuses to work for the support of those dependent upon him, and
who tho able-bodied is yet content to eat in idleness the bread which
others provide.

The existence of women of this type forms one of the most
unpleasant and unwholesome features of modern life. If any one is
so dim of vision as to fail to see what a thoroughly unlovely creature
such a woman is I wish they would read Judge Robert Grant's novel
"Unleavened Bread," ponder seriously the character of Selma, and
think of the fate that would surely overcome any nation which
developed its average and typical woman along such lines.
Unfortunately it would be untrue to say that this type exists only in
American novels. That it also exists in American life is made
unpleasantly evident by the statistics as to the dwindling families in
some localities. It is made evident in equally sinister fashion by the
census statistics as to divorce, which are fairly appalling; for easy
divorce is now as it ever has been, a bane to any nation, a curse to

society, a menace to the home, an incitement to married unhappiness
and to immorality, an evil thing for men and a still more hideous evil
for women. These unpleasant tendencies in our American life are
made evident by articles such as those which I actually read not long
ago in a certain paper, where a clergyman was quoted, seemingly
with approval, as expressing the general American attitude when he
said that the ambition of any save a very rich man should be to rear
two children only, so as to give his children an opportunity "to taste
a few of the good things of life."

This man, whose profession and calling should have made him a
moral teacher, actually set before others the ideal, not of training
children to do their duty, not of sending them forth with stout hearts
and ready minds to win triumphs for themselves and their country,
not of allowing them the opportunity, and giving them the privilege
of making their own place in the world, but, forsooth, of keeping the
number of children so limited that they might "taste a few good
things!" The way to give a child a fair chance in life is not to bring it
up in luxury, but to see that it has the kind of training that will give it
strength of character. Even apart from the vital question of national
life, and regarding only the individual interest of the children
themselves, happiness in the true sense is a hundredfold more apt to
come to any given member of a healthy family of healthy-minded
children, well brought up, well educated, but taught that they must
shift for themselves, must win their own way, and by their own
exertions make their own positions of usefulness, than it is apt to
come to those whose parents themselves have acted on and have
trained their children to act on, the selfish and sordid theory that the
whole end of life is to "taste a few good things."

The intelligence of the remark is on a par with its morality; for the
most rudimentary mental process would have shown the speaker that
if the average family in which there are children contained but two
children the nation as a whole would decrease in population so
rapidly that in two or three generations it would very deservedly be
on the point of extinction, so that the people who had acted on this
base and selfish doctrine would be giving place to others with braver
and more robust ideals. Nor would such a result be in any way
regrettable; for a race that practised such doctrine—that is, a race

that practised race suicide—would thereby conclusively show that it
was unfit to exist, and that it had better give place to people who had
not forgotten the primary laws of their being.

To sum up, then, the whole matter is simple enough. If either a race
or an individual prefers the pleasure of more effortless ease, of self-
indulgence, to the infinitely deeper, the infinitely higher pleasures
that come to those who know the toil and the weariness, but also the
joy, of hard duty well done, why, that race or that individual must
inevitably in the end pay the penalty of leading a life both vapid and
ignoble. No man and no woman really worthy of the name can care
for the life spent solely or chiefly in the avoidance of risk and
trouble and labor. Save in exceptional cases the prizes worth having
in life must be paid for, and the life worth living must be a life of
work for a worthy end, and ordinarily of work more for others than
for one's self.

The woman's task is not easy—no task worth doing is easy—but in
doing it, and when she has done it, there shall come to her the
highest and holiest joy known to mankind; and having done it, she
shall have the reward prophesied in Scripture; for her husband and
her children, yes, and all people who realize that her work lies at the
foundation of all national happiness and greatness, shall rise up and
call her blessed.

THE CALL TO DEMOCRATS
```

```
From a speech opening the National Democratic
Convention at Baltimore, Md., June, 1912.
```

It is not the wild and cruel methods of revolution and violence that
are needed to correct the abuses incident to our Government as to all
things human. Neither material nor moral progress lies that way. We
have made our Government and our complicated institutions by
appeals to reason, seeking to educate all our people that, day after
day, year after year, century after century, they may see more clearly,
act more justly, become more and more attached to the fundamental

ideas that underlie our society. If we are to preserve undiminished
the heritage bequeathed us, and add to it those accretions without
which society would perish, we shall need all the powers that the
school, the church, the court, the deliberative assembly, and the quiet
thought of our people can bring to bear.

We are called upon to do battle against the unfaithful guardians of
our Constitution and liberties and the hordes of ignorance which are
pushing forward only to the ruin of our social and governmental
fabric.

Too long has the country endured the offenses of the leaders of a
party which once knew greatness. Too long have we been blind to
the bacchanal of corruption. Too long have we listlessly watched the
assembling of the forces that threaten our country and our firesides.

The time has come when the salvation of the country demands the
restoration to place and power of men of high ideals who will wage
unceasing war against corruption in politics, who will enforce the
law against both rich and poor, and who will treat guilt as personal
and punish it accordingly.

What is our duty? To think alike as to men and measures?
Impossible! Even for our great party! There is not a reactionary
among us. All Democrats are Progressives. But it is inevitably
human that we shall not all agree that in a single highway is found
the only road to progress, or each make the same man of all our
worthy candidates his first choice.

It is impossible, however, and it is our duty to put aside all
selfishness, to consent cheerfully that the majority shall speak for
each of us, and to march out of this convention shoulder to shoulder,
intoning the praises of our chosen leader—and that will be his due,
whichever of the honorable and able men now claiming our attention
shall be chosen.

NOMINATING WOODROW WILSON
```

```
At the National Democratic Convention, Baltimore,
Maryland, June, 1912.
```

The New Jersey delegation is commissioned to represent the great
cause of Democracy and to offer you as its militant and triumphant
leader a scholar, not a charlatan; a statesman, not a doctrinaire; a
profound lawyer, not a splitter of legal hairs; a political economist,
not an egotistical theorist; a practical politician, who constructs,
modifies, restrains, without disturbance and destruction; a resistless
debater and consummate master of statement, not a mere sophist; a
humanitarian, not a defamer of characters and lives; a man whose
mind is at once cosmopolitan and composite of America; a
gentleman of unpretentious habits, with the fear of God in his heart
and the love of mankind exhibited in every act of his life; above all a
public servant who has been tried to the uttermost and never found
wanting—matchless, unconquerable, the ultimate Democrat,
Woodrow Wilson.

New Jersey has reasons for her course. Let us not be deceived in our
premises. Campaigns of vilification, corruption and false pretence
have lost their usefulness. The evolution of national energy is
towards a more intelligent morality in politics and in all other
relations. The situation admits of no compromise. The temper and
purpose of the American public will tolerate no other view. The
indifference of the American people to politics has disappeared. Any
platform and any candidate not conforming to this vast social and
commercial behest will go down to ignominious defeat at the polls.

Men are known by what they say and do. They are known by those
who hate and oppose them. Many years ago Woodrow Wilson said,
"No man is great who thinks himself so, and no man is good who
does not try to secure the happiness and comfort of others." This is
the secret of his life. The deeds of this moral and intellectual giant
are known to all men. They accord, not with the shams and false
pretences of politics, but make national harmony with the millions of
patriots determined to correct the wrongs of plutocracy and
reestablish the maxims of American liberty in all their regnant
beauty and practical effectiveness. New Jersey loves Woodrow
Wilson not for the enemies he has made. New Jersey loves him for
what he is. New Jersey argues that Woodrow Wilson is the only

candidate who can not only make Democratic success a certainty,
but secure the electoral vote of almost every State in the Union.

New Jersey will indorse his nomination by a majority of [^1]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: of
her liberated citizens. We are not building for a day, or even a
generation, but for all time. New Jersey believes that there is an
omniscience in national instinct. That instinct centers in Woodrow
Wilson. He has been in political life less than two years. He has had
no organization; only a practical ideal—the reestablishment of equal
opportunity. Not his deeds alone, not his immortal words alone, not
his personality alone, not his matchless powers alone, but all
combined compel national faith and confidence in him. Every crisis
evolves its master. Time and circumstance have evolved Woodrow
Wilson. The North, the South, the East, and the West unite in him.
New Jersey appeals to this convention to give the nation Woodrow
Wilson, that he may open the gates of opportunity to every man,
woman, and child under our flag, by reforming abuses, and thereby
teaching them, in his matchless words, "to release their energies
intelligently, that peace, justice and prosperity may reign." New
Jersey rejoices, through her freely chosen representatives, to name
for the presidency of the United States the Princeton schoolmaster,
Woodrow Wilson.

```
THE RACE PROBLEM
```

```
Delivered at the annual banquet of the Boston Merchants'
Association, at Boston, Mass., December 12, 1889.
```

MR. PRESIDENT:—Bidden by your invitation to a discussion of
the race problem—forbidden by occasion to make a political speech
—I appreciate, in trying to reconcile orders with propriety, the
perplexity of the little maid, who, bidden to learn to swim, was yet
adjured, "Now, go, my darling; hang your clothes on a hickory limb,
and don't go near the water."

The stoutest apostle of the Church, they say, is the missionary, and
the missionary, wherever he unfurls his flag, will never find himself

in deeper need of unction and address than I, bidden to-night to plant
the standard of a Southern Democrat in Boston's banquet hall, and to
discuss the problem of the races in the home of Phillips and of
Sumner. But, Mr. President, if a purpose to speak in perfect
frankness and sincerity; if earnest understanding of the vast interests
involved; if a consecrating sense of what disaster may follow further
misunderstanding and estrangement; if these may be counted upon
to steady undisciplined speech and to strengthen an untried arm—
then, sir, I shall find the courage to proceed.

Happy am I that this mission has brought my feet at last to press
New England's historic soil and my eyes to the knowledge of her
beauty and her thrift. Here within touch of Plymouth Rock and
Bunker Hill—where Webster thundered and Longfellow sang,
Emerson thought and Channing preached—here, in the cradle of
American letters and almost of American liberty, I hasten to make
the obeisance that every American owes New England when first he
stands uncovered in her mighty presence. Strange apparition! This
stern and unique figure—carved from the ocean and the wilderness
—its majesty kindling and growing amid the storms of winter and of
wars—until at last the gloom was broken, its beauty disclosed in the
sunshine, and the heroic workers rested at its base—while startled
kings and emperors gazed and marveled that from the rude touch of
this handful cast on a bleak and unknown shore should have come
the embodied genius of human government and the perfected model
of human liberty! God bless the memory of those immortal workers,
and prosper the fortunes of their living sons—and perpetuate the
inspiration of their handiwork.

Two years ago, sir, I spoke some words in New York that caught the
attention of the North. As I stand here to reiterate, as I have done
everywhere, every word I then uttered—to declare that the
sentiments I then avowed were universally approved in the South—I
realize that the confidence begotten by that speech is largely
responsible for my presence here to-night. I should dishonor myself
if I betrayed that confidence by uttering one insincere word, or by
withholding one essential element of the truth. Apropos of this last,
let me confess, Mr. President, before the praise of New England has
died on my lips, that I believe the best product of her present life is

the procession of seventeen thousand Vermont Democrats that for
twenty-two years, undiminished by death, unrecruited by birth or
conversion, have marched over their rugged hills, cast their
Democratic ballots and gone back home to pray for their
unregenerate neighbors, and awake to read the record of twenty-six
thousand Republican majority. May the God of the helpless and the
heroic help them, and may their sturdy tribe increase.

Far to the South, Mr. President, separated from this section by a line
—once defined in irrepressible difference, once traced in fratricidal
blood, and now, thank God, but a vanishing shadow—lies the fairest
and richest domain of this earth. It is the home of a brave and
hospitable people. There is centered all that can please or prosper
humankind. A perfect climate above a fertile soil yields to the
husbandman every product of the temperate zone. There, by night
the cotton whitens beneath the stars, and by day the wheat locks the
sunshine in its bearded sheaf. In the same field the clover steals the
fragrance of the wind, and tobacco catches the quick aroma of the
rains. There are mountains stored with exhaustless treasures; forests
—vast and primeval; and rivers that, tumbling or loitering, run
wanton to the sea. Of the three essential items of all industries—
cotton, iron and wood—that region has easy control. In cotton, a
fixed monopoly—in iron, proven supremacy—in timber, the reserve
supply of the Republic. From this assured and permanent advantage,
against which artificial conditions cannot much longer prevail, has
grown an amazing system of industries. Not maintained by human
contrivance of tariff or capital, afar off from the fullest and cheapest
source of supply, but resting in divine assurance, within touch of
field and mine and forest—not set amid costly farms from which
competition has driven the farmer in despair, but amid cheap and
sunny lands, rich with agriculture, to which neither season nor soil
has set a limit—this system of industries is mounting to a splendor
that shall dazzle and illumine the world. That, sir, is the picture and
the promise of my home—a land better and fairer than I have told
you, and yet but fit setting in its material excellence for the loyal and
gentle quality of its citizenship. Against that, sir, we have New
England, recruiting the Republic from its sturdy loins, shaking from
its overcrowded hives new swarms of workers, and touching this
land all over with its energy and its courage. And yet—while in the

Eldorado of which I have told you but fifteen per cent of its lands
are cultivated, its mines scarcely touched, and its population so scant
that, were it set equidistant, the sound of the human voice could not
be heard from Virginia to Texas—while on the threshold of nearly
every house in New England stands a son, seeking, with troubled
eyes, some new land in which to carry his modest patrimony, the
strange fact remains that in [^1]:[^8]:[^8]:[^0]: the South had fewer northern-born
citizens than she had in [^1]:[^8]:[^7]:[^0]:—fewer in '[^7]:[^0]: than in '[^6]:[^0]:. Why is this?
Why is it, sir, though the section line be now but a mist that the
breath may dispel, fewer men of the North have crossed it over to
the South, than when it was crimson with the best blood of the
Republic, or even when the slaveholder stood guard every inch of its
way?

There can be but one answer. It is the very problem we are now to
consider. The key that opens that problem will unlock to the world
the fairest half of this Republic, and free the halted feet of thousands
whose eyes are already kindling with its beauty. Better than this, it
will open the hearts of brothers for thirty years estranged, and clasp
in lasting comradeship a million hands now withheld in doubt.
Nothing, sir, but this problem and the suspicions it breeds, hinders a
clear understanding and a perfect union. Nothing else stands
between us and such love as bound Georgia and Massachusetts at
Valley Forge and Yorktown, chastened by the sacrifices of Manassas
and Gettysburg, and illumined with the coming of better work and a
nobler destiny than was ever wrought with the sword or sought at
the cannon's mouth.

If this does not invite your patient hearing to-night—hear one thing
more. My people, your brothers in the South—brothers in blood, in
destiny, in all that is best in our past and future—are so beset with
this problem that their very existence depends on its right solution.
Nor are they wholly to blame for its presence. The slave-ships of the
Republic sailed from your ports, the slaves worked in our fields. You
will not defend the traffic, nor I the institution. But I do here declare
that in its wise and humane administration in lifting the slave to
heights of which he had not dreamed in his savage home, and giving
him a happiness he has not yet found in freedom, our fathers left
their sons a saving and excellent heritage. In the storm of war this

institution was lost. I thank God as heartily as you do that human
slavery is gone forever from American soil. But the freedman
remains. With him, a problem without precedent or parallel. Note its
appalling conditions. Two utterly dissimilar races on the same soil—
with equal political and civil rights—almost equal in numbers, but
terribly unequal in intelligence and responsibility—each pledged
against fusion—one for a century in servitude to the other, and freed
at last by a desolating war, the experiment sought by neither but
approached by both with doubt—these are the conditions. Under
these, adverse at every point, we are required to carry these two
races in peace and honor to the end.

Never, sir, has such a task been given to mortal stewardship. Never
before in this Republic has the white race divided on the rights of an
alien race. The red man was cut down as a weed because he
hindered the way of the American citizen. The yellow man was shut
out of this Republic because he is an alien, and inferior. The red man
was owner of the land—the yellow man was highly civilized and
assimilable—but they hindered both sections and are gone! But the
black man, affecting but one section, is clothed with every privilege
of government and pinned to the soil, and my people commanded to
make good at any hazard, and at any cost, his full and equal heirship
of American privilege and prosperity. It matters not that every other
race has been routed or excluded without rhyme or reason. It matters
not that wherever the whites and the blacks have touched, in any era
or in any clime, there has been an irreconcilable violence. It matters
not that no two races, however similar, have lived anywhere, at any
time, on the same soil with equal rights in peace! In spite of these
things we are commanded to make good this change of American
policy which has not perhaps changed American prejudice—to make
certain here what has elsewhere been impossible between whites and
blacks—and to reverse, under the very worst conditions, the
universal verdict of racial history. And driven, sir, to this
superhuman task with an impatience that brooks no delay—a rigor
that accepts no excuse—and a suspicion that discourages frankness
and sincerity. We do not shrink from this trial. It is so interwoven
with our industrial fabric that we cannot disentangle it if we would
—so bound up in our honorable obligation to the world, that we
would not if we could. Can we solve it? The God who gave it into

our hands, He alone can know. But this the weakest and wisest of us
do know: we cannot solve it with less than your tolerant and patient
sympathy—with less than the knowledge that the blood that runs in
your veins is our blood—and that, when we have done our best,
whether the issue be lost or won, we shall feel your strong arms
about us and hear the beating of your approving hearts!

The resolute, clear-headed, broad-minded men of the South—the
men whose genius made glorious every page of the first seventy
years of American history—whose courage and fortitude you tested
in five years of the fiercest war—whose energy has made bricks
without straw and spread splendor amid the ashes of their war-
wasted homes—these men wear this problem in their hearts and
brains, by day and by night. They realize, as you cannot, what this
problem means—what they owe to this kindly and dependent race—
the measure of their debt to the world in whose despite they
defended and maintained slavery. And though their feet are hindered
in its undergrowth, and their march cumbered with its burdens, they
have lost neither the patience from which comes clearness, nor the
faith from which comes courage. Nor, sir, when in passionate
moments is disclosed to them that vague and awful shadow, with its
lurid abysses and its crimson stains, into which I pray God they may
never go, are they struck with more of apprehension than is needed
to complete their consecration!

Such is the temper of my people. But what of the problem itself? Mr.
President, we need not go one step further unless you concede right
here that the people I speak for are as honest, as sensible and as just
as your people, seeking as earnestly as you would in their place to
rightly solve the problem that touches them at every vital point. If
you insist that they are ruffians, blindly striving with bludgeon and
shotgun to plunder and oppress a race, then I shall sacrifice my self-
respect and tax your patience in vain. But admit that they are men of
common sense and common honesty, wisely modifying an
environment they cannot wholly disregard—guiding and controlling
as best they can the vicious and irresponsible of either race—
compensating error with frankness, and retrieving in patience what
they lost in passion—and conscious all the time that wrong means
ruin—admit this, and we may reach an understanding to-night.

The President of the United States, in his late message to Congress,
discussing the plea that the South should be left to solve this
problem, asks: "Are they at work upon it? What solution do they
offer? When will the black man cast a free ballot? When will he
have the civil rights that are his?" I shall not here protest against a
partisanry that, for the first time in our history, in time of peace, has
stamped with the great seal of our government a stigma upon the
people of a great and loyal section; though I gratefully remember
that the great dead soldier, who held the helm of State for the eight
stormiest years of reconstruction, never found need for such a step;
and though there is no personal sacrifice I would not make to
remove this cruel and unjust imputation on my people from the
archives of my country! But, sir, backed by a record, on every page
of which is progress, I venture to make earnest and respectful
answer to the questions that are asked. We give to the world this year
a crop of [^7]:,[^5]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: bales of cotton, worth $[^4]:[^5]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:, and its
cash equivalent in grain, grasses and fruit. This enormous crop could
not have come from the hands of sullen and discontented labor. It
comes from peaceful fields, in which laughter and gossip rise above
the hum of industry, and contentment runs with the singing plough.
It is claimed that this ignorant labor is defrauded of its just hire, I
present the tax books of Georgia, which show that the negro twenty-
five years ago a slave, has in Georgia alone $[^1]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: of assessed
property, worth twice that much. Does not that record honor him and
vindicate his neighbors?

What people, penniless, illiterate, has done so well? For every Afro-
American agitator, stirring the strife in which alone he prospers, I
can show you a thousand negroes, happy in their cabin homes,
tilling their own land by day, and at night taking from the lips of
their children the helpful message their State sends them from the
schoolhouse door. And the schoolhouse itself bears testimony. In
Georgia we added last year $[^2]:[^5]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: to the school fund, making a
total of more than $[^1]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:—and this in the face of prejudice not
yet conquered—of the fact that the whites are assessed for
$[^3]:[^6]:[^8]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:, the blacks for $[^1]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:, and yet forty-nine per
cent of the beneficiaries are black children; and in the doubt of many
wise men if education helps, or can help, our problem. Charleston,
with her taxable values cut half in two since [^1]:[^8]:[^6]:[^0]:, pays more in

proportion for public schools than Boston. Although it is easier to
give much out of much than little out of little, the South, with one-
seventh of the taxable property of the country, with relatively larger
debt, having received only one-twelfth as much of public lands, and
having back of its tax books none of the $[^5]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: of bonds that
enrich the North—and though it pays annually $[^2]:[^6]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: to your
section as pensions—yet gives nearly one-sixth to the public school
fund. The South since [^1]:[^8]:[^6]:[^5]: has spent $[^1]:[^2]:[^2]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: in education,
and this year is pledged to $[^3]:[^2]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: more for State and city
schools, although the blacks, paying one-thirtieth of the taxes, get
nearly one-half of the fund. Go into our fields and see whites and
blacks working side by side. On our buildings in the same squad. In
our shops at the same forge. Often the blacks crowd the whites from
work, or lower wages by their greater need and simpler habits, and
yet are permitted, because we want to bar them from no avenue in
which their feet are fitted to tread. They could not there be elected
orators of white universities, as they have been here, but they do
enter there a hundred useful trades that are closed against them here.
We hold it better and wiser to tend the weeds in the garden than to
water the exotic in the window.

In the South there are negro lawyers, teachers, editors, dentists,
doctors, preachers, multiplying with the increasing ability of their
race to support them. In villages and towns they have their military
companies equipped from the armories of the State, their churches
and societies built and supported largely by their neighbors. What is
the testimony of the courts? In penal legislation we have steadily
reduced felonies to misdemeanors, and have led the world in
mitigating punishment for crime, that we might save, as far as
possible, this dependent race from its own weakness. In our
penitentiary record sixty per cent of the prosecutors are negroes, and
in every court the negro criminal strikes the colored juror, that white
men may judge his case.

In the North, one negro in every [^1]:[^8]:[^5]: is in jail—in the South, only
one in [^4]:[^4]:[^6]:. In the North the percentage of negro prisoners is six
times as great as that of native whites; in the South, only four times
as great. If prejudice wrongs him in Southern courts, the record
shows it to be deeper in Northern courts. I assert here, and a bar as

intelligent and upright as the bar of Massachusetts will solemnly
indorse my assertion, that in the Southern courts, from highest to
lowest, pleading for life, liberty or property, the negro has distinct
advantage because he is a negro, apt to be overreached, oppressed—
and that this advantage reaches from the juror in making his verdict
to the judge in measuring his sentence.

Now, Mr. President, can it be seriously maintained that we are
terrorizing the people from whose willing hands comes every year
$[^1]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: of farm crops? Or have robbed a people who,
twenty-five years from unrewarded slavery, have amassed in one
State $[^2]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: of property? Or that we intend to oppress the
people we are arming every day? Or deceive them, when we are
educating them to the utmost limit of our ability? Or outlaw them,
when we work side by side with them? Or re-enslave them under
legal forms, when for their benefit we have even imprudently
narrowed the limit of felonies and mitigated the severity of law? My
fellow-countrymen, as you yourselves may sometimes have to
appeal at the bar of human judgment for justice and for right, give to
my people to-night the fair and unanswerable conclusion of these
incontestable facts.

But it is claimed that under this fair seeming there is disorder and
violence. This I admit. And there will be until there is one ideal
community on earth after which we may pattern. But how widely is
it misjudged! It is hard to measure with exactness whatever touches
the negro. His helplessness, his isolation, his century of servitude,—
these dispose us to emphasize and magnify his wrongs. This
disposition, inflamed by prejudice and partisanry, has led to injustice
and delusion. Lawless men may ravage a county in Iowa and it is
accepted as an incident—in the South, a drunken row is declared to
be the fixed habit of the community. Regulators may whip
vagabonds in Indiana by platoons and it scarcely arrests attention—a
chance collision in the South among relatively the same classes is
gravely accepted as evidence that one race is destroying the other.
We might as well claim that the Union was ungrateful to the colored
soldier who followed its flag because a Grand Army post in
Connecticut closed its doors to a negro veteran as for you to give
racial significance to every incident in the South, or to accept

exceptional grounds as the rule of our society. I am not one of those
who becloud American honor with the parade of the outrages of
either section, and belie American character by declaring them to be
significant and representative. I prefer to maintain that they are
neither, and stand for nothing but the passion and sin of our poor
fallen humanity. If society, like a machine, were no stronger than its
weakest part, I should despair of both sections. But, knowing that
society, sentient and responsible in every fiber, can mend and repair
until the whole has the strength of the best, I despair of neither.
These gentlemen who come with me here, knit into Georgia's busy
life as they are, never saw, I dare assert, an outrage committed on a
negro! And if they did, no one of you would be swifter to prevent or
punish. It is through them, and the men and women who think with
them—making nine-tenths of every Southern community—that
these two races have been carried thus far with less of violence than
would have been possible anywhere else on earth. And in their
fairness and courage and steadfastness—more than in all the laws
that can be passed, or all the bayonets that can be mustered—is the
hope of our future.

When will the blacks cast a free ballot? When ignorance anywhere is
not dominated by the will of the intelligent; when the laborer
anywhere casts a vote unhindered by his boss; when the vote of the
poor anywhere is not influenced by the power of the rich; when the
strong and the steadfast do not everywhere control the suffrage of
the weak and shiftless—then, and not till then, will the ballot of the
negro be free. The white people of the South are banded, Mr.
President, not in prejudice against the blacks—not in sectional
estrangement—not in the hope of political dominion—but in a deep
and abiding necessity. Here is this vast ignorant and purchasable
vote—clannish, credulous, impulsive, and passionate—tempting
every art of the demagogue, but insensible to the appeal of the
stateman. Wrongly started, in that it was led into alienation from its
neighbor and taught to rely on the protection of an outside force, it
cannot be merged and lost in the two great parties through logical
currents, for it lacks political conviction and even that information
on which conviction must be based. It must remain a faction—strong
enough in every community to control on the slightest division of
the whites. Under that division it becomes the prey of the cunning

and unscrupulous of both parties. Its credulity is imposed upon, its
patience inflamed, its cupidity tempted, its impulses misdirected—
and even its superstition made to play its part in a campaign in
which every interest of society is jeopardized and every approach to
the ballot-box debauched. It is against such campaigns as this—the
folly and the bitterness and the danger of which every Southern
community has drunk deeply—that the white people of the South are
banded together. Just as you in Massachusetts would be banded if
[^3]:[^0]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: men, not one in a hundred able to read his ballot—banded
in race instinct, holding against you the memory of a century of
slavery, taught by your late conquerors to distrust and oppose you,
had already travestied legislation from your State House, and in
every species of folly or villainy had wasted your substance and
exhausted your credit.

But admitting the right of the whites to unite against this tremendous
menace, we are challenged with the smallness of our vote. This has
long been flippantly charged to be evidence and has now been
solemnly and officially declared to be proof of political turpitude
and baseness on our part. Let us see. Virginia—a state now under
fierce assault for this alleged crime—cast in [^1]:[^8]:[^8]:[^8]: seventy-five per
cent of her vote; Massachusetts, the State in which I speak, sixty per
cent of her vote. Was it suppression in Virginia and natural causes in
Massachusetts? Last month Virginia cast sixty-nine per cent of her
vote; and Massachusetts, fighting in every district, cast only forty-
nine per cent of hers. If Virginia is condemned because thirty-one
per cent of her vote was silent, how shall this State escape, in which
fifty-one per cent was dumb? Let us enlarge this comparison. The
sixteen Southern States in '[^8]:[^8]: cast sixty-seven per cent of their total
vote—the six New England States but sixty-three per cent of theirs.
By what fair rule shall the stigma be put upon one section while the
other escapes? A congressional election in New York last week, with
the polling place in touch of every voter, brought out only [^6]:,000
votes of [^2]:[^8]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:—and the lack of opposition is assigned as the
natural cause. In a district in my State, in which an opposition
speech has not been heard in ten years and the polling places are
miles apart—under the unfair reasoning of which my section has
been a constant victim—the small vote is charged to be proof of
forcible suppression. In Virginia an average majority of [^1]:[^2]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:,

unless hopeless division of the minority, was raised to [^4]:[^2]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:; in
Iowa, in the same election, a majority of [^3]:[^2]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: was wiped out and
an opposition majority of [^8]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: was established. The change of
[^4]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: votes in Iowa is accepted as political revolution—in Virginia
an increase of [^3]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]: on a safe majority is declared to be proof of
political fraud.

It is deplorable, sir, that in both sections a larger percentage of the
vote is not regularly cast, but more inexplicable that this should be
so in New England than in the South. What invites the negro to the
ballot-box? He knows that of all men it has promised him most and
yielded him least. His first appeal to suffrage was the promise of
"forty acres and a mule;" his second, the threat that Democratic
success meant his re-enslavement. Both have been proved false in
his experience. He looked for a home, and he got the Freedman's
Bank. He fought under promise of the loaf, and in victory was
denied the crumbs. Discouraged and deceived, he has realized at last
that his best friends are his neighbors with whom his lot is cast, and
whose prosperity is bound up in his—and that he has gained nothing
in politics to compensate the loss of their confidence and sympathy,
that is at last his best and enduring hope. And so, without leaders or
organization—and lacking the resolute heroism of my party friends
in Vermont that make their hopeless march over the hills a high and
inspiring pilgrimage—he shrewdly measures the occasional agitator,
balances his little account with politics, touches up his mule, and
jogs down the furrow, letting the mad world wag as it will!

The negro voter can never control in the South, and it would be well
if partisans at the North would understand this. I have seen the white
people of a State set about by black hosts until their fate seemed
sealed. But, sir, some brave men, banding them together, would rise
as Elisha rose in beleaguered Samaria, and, touching their eyes with
faith, bid them look abroad to see the very air "filled with the
chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof." If there is any human
force that cannot be withstood, it is the power of the banded
intelligence and responsibility of a free community. Against it,
numbers and corruption cannot prevail. It cannot be forbidden in the
law, or divorced in force. It is the inalienable right of every free
community—the just and righteous safeguard against an ignorant or

corrupt suffrage. It is on this, sir, that we rely in the South. Not the
cowardly menace of mask or shotgun, but the peaceful majesty of
intelligence and responsibility, massed and unified for the protection
of its homes and the preservation of its liberty. That, sir, is our
reliance and our hope, and against it all the powers of earth shall not
prevail. It is just as certain that Virginia would come back to the
unchallenged control of her white race—that before the moral and
material power of her people once more unified, opposition would
crumble until its last desperate leader was left alone, vainly striving
to rally his disordered hosts—as that night should fade in the
kindling glory of the sun. You may pass force bills, but they will not
avail. You may surrender your own liberties to federal election law;
you may submit, in fear of a necessity that does not exist, that the
very form of this government may be changed; you may invite
federal interference with the New England town meeting, that has
been for a hundred years the guarantee of local government in
America; this old State—which holds in its charter the boast that it
"is a free and independent commonwealth"—may deliver its election
machinery into the hands of the government it helped to create—but
never, sir, will a single State of this Union, North or South, be
delivered again to the control of an ignorant and inferior race. We
wrested our state governments from negro supremacy when the
Federal drumbeat rolled closer to the ballot-box, and Federal
bayonets hedged it deeper about than will ever again be permitted in
this free government. But, sir, though the cannon of this Republic
thundered in every voting district in the South, we still should find in
the mercy of God the means and the courage to prevent its
reestablishment.

I regret, sir, that my section, hindered with this problem, stands in
seeming estrangement to the North. If, sir, any man will point out to
me a path down which the white people of the South, divided, may
walk in peace and honor, I will take that path, though I take it alone
—for at its end, and nowhere else, I fear, is to be found the full
prosperity of my section and the full restoration of this Union. But,
sir, if the negro had not been enfranchised the South would have
been divided and the Republic united. His enfranchisement—against
which I enter no protest—holds the South united and compact. What
solution, then, can we offer for the problem? Time alone can

disclose it to us. We simply report progress, and ask your patience. If
the problem be solved at all—and I firmly believe it will, though
nowhere else has it been—it will be solved by the people most
deeply bound in interest, most deeply pledged in honor to its
solution. I had rather see my people render back this question rightly
solved than to see them gather all the spoils over which faction has
contended since Cataline conspired and Cæsar fought. Meantime we
treat the negro fairly, measuring to him justice in the fulness the
strong should give to the weak, and leading him in the steadfast
ways of citizenship, that he may no longer be the prey of the
unscrupulous and the sport of the thoughtless. We open to him every
pursuit in which he can prosper, and seek to broaden his training and
capacity. We seek to hold his confidence and friendship—and to pin
him to the soil with ownership, that he may catch in the fire of his
own hearthstone that sense of responsibility the shiftless can never
know. And we gather him into that alliance of intelligence and
responsibility that, though it now runs close to racial lines,
welcomes the responsible and intelligent of any race. By this course,
confirmed in our judgment, and justified in the progress already
made, we hope to progress slowly but surely to the end.

The love we feel for that race, you cannot measure nor comprehend.
As I attest it here, the spirit of my old black mammy, from her home
up there, looks down to bless, and through the tumult of this night
steals the sweet music of her croonings as thirty years ago she held
me in her black arms and led me smiling to sleep. This scene
vanishes as I speak, and I catch a vision of an old Southern home
with its lofty pillars and its white pigeons fluttering down through
the golden air. I see women with strained and anxious faces, and
children alert yet helpless. I see night come down with its dangers
and its apprehensions, and in a big homely room I feel on my tired
head the touch of loving hands—now worn and wrinkled, but fairer
to me yet than the hands of mortal woman, and stronger yet to lead
me than the hands of mortal man—as they lay a mother's blessing
there, while at her knees—the truest altar I yet have found—I thank
God that she is safe in her sanctuary, because her slaves, sentinel in
the silent cabin, or guard at her chamber door, put a black man's
loyalty between her and danger.

I catch another vision. The crisis of battle—a soldier, struck,
staggering, fallen. I see a slave, scuffing through the smoke, winding
his black arms about the fallen form, reckless of hurtling death—
bending his trusty face to catch the words that tremble on the
stricken lips, so wrestling meantime with agony that he would lay
down his life in his master's stead. I see him by the weary bedside,
ministering with uncomplaining patience, praying with all his
humble heart that God will lift his master up, until death comes in
mercy and in honor to still the soldier's agony and seal the soldier's
life. I see him by the open grave—mute, motionless, uncovered,
suffering for the death of him who in life fought against his freedom.
I see him, when the mold is heaped and the great drama of his life is
closed, turn away and with downcast eyes and uncertain step start
out into new and strange fields, faltering, struggling, but moving on,
until his shambling figure is lost in the light of this better and
brighter day. And from the grave comes a voice, saying, "Follow
him! put your arms about him in his need, even as he put his about
me. Be his friend as he was mine." And out into this new world—
strange to me as to him, dazzling, bewildering both—I follow! And
may God forget my people—when they forget these!

Whatever the future may hold for them, whether they plod along in
the servitude from which they have never been lifted since the
Cyrenian was laid hold upon by the Roman soldiers, and made to
bear the cross of the fainting Christ—whether they find homes again
in Africa, and thus hasten the prophecy of the psalmist, who said,
"And suddenly Ethiopia shall hold out her hands unto God"—
whether forever dislocated and separate, they remain a weak people,
beset by stronger, and exist, as the Turk, who lives in the jealousy
rather than in the conscience of Europe—or whether in this
miraculous Republic they break through the caste of twenty
centuries and, belying universal history, reach the full stature of
citizenship, and in peace maintain it—we shall give them uttermost
justice and abiding friendship. And whatever we do, into whatever
seeming estrangement we may be driven, nothing shall disturb the
love we bear this Republic, or mitigate our consecration to its
service. I stand here, Mr. President, to profess no new loyalty. When
General Lee, whose heart was the temple of our hopes, and whose
arm was clothed with our strength, renewed his allegiance to this

Government at Appomattox, he spoke from a heart too great to be
false, and he spoke for every honest man from Maryland to Texas.
From that day to this Hamilcar has nowhere in the South sworn
young Hannibal to hatred and vengeance, but everywhere to loyalty
and to love. Witness the veteran standing at the base of a
Confederate monument, above the graves of his comrades, his empty
sleeve tossing in the April wind, adjuring the young men about him
to serve as earnest and loyal citizens the Government against which
their fathers fought. This message, delivered from that sacred
presence, has gone home to the hearts of my fellows! And, sir, I
declare here, if physical courage be always equal to human
aspiration, that they would die, sir, if need be, to restore this
Republic their fathers fought to dissolve.

Such, Mr. President, is this problem as we see it, such is the temper
in which we approach it, such the progress made. What do we ask of
you? First, patience; out of this alone can come perfect work.
Second, confidence; in this alone can you judge fairly. Third,
sympathy; in this you can help us best. Fourth, give us your sons as
hostages. When you plant your capital in millions, send your sons
that they may know how true are our hearts and may help to swell
the Caucasian current until it can carry without danger this black
infusion. Fifth, loyalty to the Republic—for there is sectionalism in
loyalty as in estrangement. This hour little needs the loyalty that is
loyal to one section and yet holds the other in enduring suspicion
and estrangement. Give us the broad and perfect loyalty that loves
and trusts Georgia alike with Massachusetts—that knows no South,
no North, no East, no West, but endears with equal and patriotic love
every foot of our soil, every State of our Union.

A mighty duty, sir, and a mighty inspiration impels every one of us
to-night to lose in patriotic consecration whatever estranges,
whatever divides. We, sir, are Americans—and we stand for human
liberty! The uplifting force of the American idea is under every
throne on earth. France, Brazil—these are our victories. To redeem
the earth from kingcraft and oppression—this is our mission! And
we shall not fail. God has sown in our soil the seed of His millennial
harvest, and He will not lay the sickle to the ripening crop until His
full and perfect day has come. Our history, sir, has been a constant

and expanding miracle, from Plymouth Rock and Jamestown, all the
way—aye, even from the hour when from the voiceless and traceless
ocean a new world rose to the sight of the inspired sailor. As we
approach the fourth centennial of that stupendous day—when the old
world will come to marvel and to learn amid our gathered treasures
—let us resolve to crown the miracles of our past with the spectacle
of a Republic, compact, united, indissoluble in the bonds of love—
loving from the Lakes to the Gulf—the wounds of war healed in
every heart as on every hill, serene and resplendent at the summit of
human achievement and earthly glory, blazing out the path and
making clear the way up which all the nations of the earth must
come in God's appointed time!

LAST SPEECH
```

```
Delivered at the World's Fair, Buffalo, N.Y., on
September 5, 1901, the day before he was assassinated.
```

I am glad again to be in the city of Buffalo and exchange greetings
with her people, to whose generous hospitality I am not a stranger,
and with whose good will I have been repeatedly and signally
honored. To-day I have additional satisfaction in meeting and giving
welcome to the foreign representatives assembled here, whose
presence and participation in this Exposition have contributed in so
marked a degree to its interest and success. To the commissioners of
the Dominion of Canada and the British Colonies, the French
Colonies, the Republics of Mexico and of Central and South
America, and the commissioners of Cuba and Porto Rico, who share
with us in this undertaking, we give the hand of fellowship and
felicitate with them upon the triumphs of art, science, education and
manufacture which the old has bequeathed to the new century.

Expositions are the timekeepers of progress. They record the world's
advancement. They stimulate the energy, enterprise and intellect of
the people, and quicken human genius. They go into the home. They
broaden and brighten the daily life of the people. They open mighty
storehouses of information to the student. Every exposition, great or

small, has helped to some onward step.

Comparison of ideas is always educational and, as such, instructs the
brain and hand of man. Friendly rivalry follows, which is the spur to
industrial improvement, the inspiration to useful invention and to
high endeavor in all departments of human activity. It exacts a study
of the wants, comforts, and even the whims of the people, and
recognizes the efficacy of high quality and low prices to win their
favor. The quest for trade is an incentive to men of business to
devise, invent, improve and economize in the cost of production.
Business life, whether among ourselves, or with other peoples, is
ever a sharp struggle for success. It will be none the less in the
future.

Without competition we would be clinging to the clumsy and
antiquated process of farming and manufacture and the methods of
business of long ago, and the twentieth would be no further
advanced than the eighteenth century. But tho commercial
competitors we are, commercial enemies we must not be. The Pan-
American Exposition has done its work thoroughly, presenting in its
exhibits evidences of the highest skill and illustrating the progress of
the human family in the Western Hemisphere. This portion of the
earth has no cause for humiliation for the part it has performed in the
march of civilization. It has not accomplished everything; far from
it. It has simply done its best, and without vanity or boastfulness,
and recognizing the manifold achievements of others it invites the
friendly rivalry of all the powers in the peaceful pursuits of trade and
commerce, and will cooperate with all in advancing the highest and
best interests of humanity. The wisdom and energy of all the nations
are none too great for the world work. The success of art, science,
industry and invention is an international asset and a common glory.

After all, how near one to the other is every part of the world.
Modern inventions have brought into close relation widely separated
peoples and make them better acquainted. Geographic and political
divisions will continue to exist, but distances have been effaced.
Swift ships and fast trains are becoming cosmopolitan. They invade
fields which a few years ago were impenetrable. The world's
products are exchanged as never before and with increasing
transportation facilities come increasing knowledge and larger trade.

Prices are fixed with mathematical precision by supply and demand.
The world's selling prices are regulated by market and crop reports.
We travel greater distances in a shorter space of time and with more
ease than was ever dreamed of by the fathers. Isolation is no longer
possible or desirable. The same important news is read, tho in
different languages, the same day in all Christendom.

The telegraph keeps us advised of what is occurring everywhere, and
the Press foreshadows, with more or less accuracy, the plans and
purposes of the nations. Market prices of products and of securities
are hourly known in every commercial mart, and the investments of
the people extend beyond their own national boundaries into the
remotest parts of the earth. Vast transactions are conducted and
international exchanges are made by the tick of the cable. Every
event of interest is immediately bulletined. The quick gathering and
transmission of news, like rapid transit, are of recent origin, and are
only made possible by the genius of the inventor and the courage of
the investor. It took a special messenger of the government, with
every facility known at the time for rapid travel, nineteen days to go
from the City of Washington to New Orleans with a message to
General Jackson that the war with England had ceased and a treaty
of peace had been signed. How different now! We reached General
Miles, in Porto Rico, and he was able through the military telegraph
to stop his army on the firing line with the message that the United
States and Spain had signed a protocol suspending hostilities. We
knew almost instanter of the first shots fired at Santiago, and the
subsequent surrender of the Spanish forces was known at
Washington within less than an hour of its consummation. The first
ship of Cervera's fleet had hardly emerged from that historic harbor
when the fact was flashed to our Capitol, and the swift destruction
that followed was announced immediately through the wonderful
medium of telegraphy.

So accustomed are we to safe and easy communication with distant
lands that its temporary interruption, even in ordinary times, results
in loss and inconvenience. We shall never forget the days of anxious
waiting and suspense when no information was permitted to be sent
from Pekin, and the diplomatic representatives of the nations in
China, cut off from all communication, inside and outside of the

walled capital, were surrounded by an angry and misguided mob that
threatened their lives; nor the joy that thrilled the world when a
single message from the government of the United States brought
through our minister the first news of the safety of the besieged
diplomats.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century there was not a mile of
steam railroad on the globe; now there are enough miles to make its
circuit many times. Then there was not a line of electric telegraph;
now we have a vast mileage traversing all lands and seas. God and
man have linked the nations together. No nation can longer be
indifferent to any other. And as we are brought more and more in
touch with each other, the less occasion is there for
misunderstandings, and the stronger the disposition, when we have
differences, to adjust them in the court of arbitration, which is the
noblest forum for the settlement of international disputes.

My fellow citizens, trade statistics indicate that this country is in a
state of unexampled prosperity. The figures are almost appalling.
They show that we are utilizing our fields and forests and mines, and
that we are furnishing profitable employment to the millions of
workingmen throughout the United States, bringing comfort and
happiness to their homes, and making it possible to lay by savings
for old age and disability. That all the people are participating in this
great prosperity is seen in every American community and shown by
the enormous and unprecedented deposits in our savings banks. Our
duty in the care and security of these deposits and their safe
investment demands the highest integrity and the best business
capacity of those in charge of these depositories of the people's
earnings.

We have a vast and intricate business, built up through years of toil
and struggle in which every part of the country has its stake, which
will not permit of either neglect or of undue selfishness. No narrow,
sordid policy will subserve it. The greatest skill and wisdom on the
part of manufacturers and producers will be required to hold and
increase it. Our industrial enterprises, which have grown to such
great proportions, affect the homes and occupations of the people
and the welfare of the country. Our capacity to produce has
developed so enormously and our products have so multiplied that
the problem of more markets requires our urgent and immediate
attention. Only a broad and enlightened policy will keep what we
have. No other policy will get more. In these times of marvelous
business energy and gain we ought to be looking to the future,
strengthening the weak places in our industrial and commercial
systems, that we may be ready for any storm or strain.

By sensible trade arrangements which will not interrupt our home
production we shall extend the outlets for our increasing surplus. A
system which provides a mutual exchange of commodities is
manifestly essential to the continued and healthful growth of our
export trade. We must not repose in the fancied security that we can
forever sell everything and buy little or nothing. If such a thing were
possible it would not be best for us or for those with whom we deal.
We should take from our customers such of their products as we can
use without harm to our industries and labor. Reciprocity is the
natural outgrowth of our wonderful industrial development under the
domestic policy now firmly established.

What we produce beyond our domestic consumption must have a
vent abroad. The excess must be relieved through a foreign outlet,
and we should sell everywhere we can and buy wherever the buying
will enlarge our sales and productions, and thereby make a greater
demand for home labor.

The period of exclusiveness is past. The expansion of our trade and
commerce is the pressing problem. Commercial wars are
unprofitable. A policy of good will and friendly trade relations will
prevent reprisals. Reciprocity treaties are in harmony with the spirit
of the times; measures of retaliation are not. If, perchance, some of

our tariffs are no longer needed for revenue or to encourage and
protect our industries at home, why should they not be employed to
extend and promote our markets abroad? Then, too, we have
inadequate steamship service. New lines of steamships have already
been put in commission between the Pacific coast ports of the
United States and those on the western coasts of Mexico and Central
and South America. These should be followed up with direct
steamship lines between the western coast of the United States and
South American ports. One of the needs of the times is direct
commercial lines from our vast fields of production to the fields of
consumption that we have but barely touched. Next in advantage to
having the thing to sell is to have the conveyance to carry it to the
buyer. We must encourage our merchant marine. We must have more
ships. They must be under the American flag; built and manned and
owned by Americans. These will not only be profitable in a
commercial sense; they will be messengers of peace and amity
wherever they go.

We must build the Isthmian canal, which will unite the two oceans
and give a straight line of water communication with the western
coasts of Central and South America and Mexico. The construction
of a Pacific cable can not be longer postponed. In the furtherance of
these objects of national interest and concern you are performing an
important part. This Exposition would have touched the heart of that
American statesman whose mind was ever alert and thought ever
constant for a larger commerce and a truer fraternity of the republics
of the New World. His broad American spirit is felt and manifested
here. He needs no identification to an assemblage of Americans
anywhere, for the name of Blaine is inseparably associated with the
Pan-American movement which finds here practical and substantial
expression, and which we all hope will be firmly advanced by the
Pan-American Congress that assembles this autumn in the capital of
Mexico. The good work will go on. It can not be stopped. Those
buildings will disappear; this creation of art and beauty and industry
will perish from sight, but their influence will remain to "make it
live beyond its too short living with praises and thanksgiving." Who
can tell the new thoughts that have been awakened, the ambitions
fired and the high achievements that will be wrought through this
Exposition?

Gentlemen, let us ever remember that our interest is in concord, not
conflict; and that our real eminence rests in the victories of peace,
not those of war. We hope that all who are represented here may be
moved to higher and nobler efforts for their own and the world's
good, and that out of this city may come not only greater commerce
and trade for us all, but, more essential than these, relations of
mutual respect, confidence and friendship which will deepen and
endure. Our earnest prayer is that God will graciously vouchsafe
prosperity, happiness and peace to all our neighbors, and like
blessings to all the peoples and powers of earth.

TRIBUTE TO MCKINLEY
```

```
From his memorial address at a joint session of the Senate
and House of Representatives on February 27, 1903.
```

For the third time the Congress of the United States are assembled to
commemorate the life and the death of a president slain by the hand
of an assassin. The attention of the future historian will be attracted
to the features which reappear with startling sameness in all three of
these awful crimes: the uselessness, the utter lack of consequence of
the act; the obscurity, the insignificance of the criminal; the
blamelessness—so far as in our sphere of existence the best of men
may be held blameless—of the victim. Not one of our murdered
presidents had an enemy in the world; they were all of such
preeminent purity of life that no pretext could be given for the attack
of passional crime; they were all men of democratic instincts, who
could never have offended the most jealous advocates of equity;
they were of kindly and generous nature, to whom wrong or
injustice was impossible; of moderate fortune, whose slender means
nobody could envy. They were men of austere virtue, of tender
heart, of eminent abilities, which they had devoted with single minds
to the good of the Republic. If ever men walked before God and man
without blame, it was these three rulers of our people. The only
temptation to attack their lives offered was their gentle radiance—to
eyes hating the light, that was offense enough.

The stupid uselessness of such an infamy affronts the common sense
of the world. One can conceive how the death of a dictator may
change the political conditions of an empire; how the extinction of a
narrowing line of kings may bring in an alien dynasty. But in a well-
ordered Republic like ours the ruler may fall, but the State feels no
tremor. Our beloved and revered leader is gone—but the natural
process of our laws provides us a successor, identical in purpose and
ideals, nourished by the same teachings, inspired by the same
principles, pledged by tender affection as well as by high loyalty to
carry to completion the immense task committed to his hands, and to
smite with iron severity every manifestation of that hideous crime
which his mild predecessor, with his dying breath, forgave. The
sayings of celestial wisdom have no date; the words that reach us,
over two thousand years, out of the darkest hour of gloom the world
has ever known, are true to life to-day: "They know not what they
do." The blow struck at our dear friend and ruler was as deadly as
blind hate could make it; but the blow struck at anarchy was deadlier
still.

How many countries can join with us in the community of a kindred
sorrow! I will not speak of those distant regions where assassination
enters into the daily life of government. But among the nations
bound to us by the ties of familiar intercourse—who can forget that
wise and mild autocrat who had earned the proud title of the
liberator? that enlightened and magnanimous citizen whom France
still mourns? that brave and chivalrous king of Italy who only lived
for his people? and, saddest of all, that lovely and sorrowing
empress, whose harmless life could hardly have excited the
animosity of a demon? Against that devilish spirit nothing avails,—
neither virtue nor patriotism, nor age nor youth, nor conscience nor
pity. We can not even say that education is a sufficient safeguard
against this baleful evil,—for most of the wretches whose crimes
have so shocked humanity in recent years were men not unlettered,
who have gone from the common schools, through murder to the
scaffold.

The life of William McKinley was, from his birth to his death,
typically American. There is no environment, I should say,
anywhere else in the world which could produce just such a

character. He was born into that way of life which elsewhere is
called the middle class, but which in this country is so nearly
universal as to make of other classes an almost negligible quantity.
He was neither rich nor poor, neither proud nor humble; he knew no
hunger he was not sure of satisfying, no luxury which could enervate
mind or body. His parents were sober, God-fearing people;
intelligent and upright, without pretension and without humility. He
grew up in the company of boys like himself, wholesome, honest,
self-respecting. They looked down on nobody; they never felt it
possible they could be looked down upon. Their houses were the
homes of probity, piety, patriotism. They learned in the admirable
school readers of fifty years ago the lessons of heroic and splendid
life which have come down from the past. They read in their weekly
newspapers the story of the world's progress, in which they were
eager to take part, and of the sins and wrongs of civilization with
which they burned to do battle. It was a serious and thoughtful time.
The boys of that day felt dimly, but deeply, that days of sharp
struggle and high achievement were before them. They looked at life
with the wondering yet resolute eyes of a young esquire in his vigil
of arms. They felt a time was coming when to them should be
addressed the stern admonition of the Apostle, "Quit you like men;
be strong."

The men who are living to-day and were young in [^1]:[^8]:[^6]:[^0]: will never
forget the glory and glamour that filled the earth and the sky when
the long twilight of doubt and uncertainty was ending and the time
for action had come. A speech by Abraham Lincoln was an event not
only of high moral significance, but of far-reaching importance; the
drilling of a militia company by Ellsworth attracted national
attention; the fluttering of the flag in the clear sky drew tears from
the eyes of young men. Patriotism, which had been a rhetorical
expression, became a passionate emotion, in which instinct, logic
and feeling were fused. The country was worth saving; it could be
saved only by fire; no sacrifice was too great; the young men of the
country were ready for the sacrifice; come weal, come woe, they
were ready.

At seventeen years of age William McKinley heard this summons of
his country. He was the sort of youth to whom a military life in

ordinary times would possess no attractions. His nature was far
different from that of the ordinary soldier. He had other dreams of
life, its prizes and pleasures, than that of marches and battles. But to
his mind there was no choice or question. The banner floating in the
morning breeze was the beckoning gesture of his country. The
thrilling notes of the trumpet called him—him and none other—into
the ranks. His portrait in his first uniform is familiar to you all—the
short, stocky figure; the quiet, thoughtful face; the deep, dark eyes. It
is the face of a lad who could not stay at home when he thought he
was needed in the field. He was of the stuff of which good soldiers
are made. Had he been ten years older he would have entered at the
head of a company and come out at the head of a division. But he
did what he could. He enlisted as a private; he learned to obey. His
serious, sensible ways, his prompt, alert efficiency soon attracted the
attention of his superiors. He was so faithful in little things that they
gave him more and more to do. He was untiring in camp and on the
march; swift, cool and fearless in fight. He left the army with field
rank when the war ended, brevetted by President Lincoln for
gallantry in battle.

In coming years when men seek to draw the moral of our great Civil
War, nothing will seem to them so admirable in all the history of our
two magnificent armies as the way in which the war came to a close.
When the Confederate army saw the time had come, they
acknowledged the pitiless logic of facts and ceased fighting. When
the army of the Union saw it was no longer needed, without a
murmur or question, making no terms, asking no return, in the flush
of victory and fulness of might, it laid down its arms and melted
back into the mass of peaceful citizens. There is no event since the
nation was born which has so proved its solid capacity for self-
government. Both sections share equally in that crown of glory.
They had held a debate of incomparable importance and had fought
it out with equal energy. A conclusion had been reached—and it is to
the everlasting honor of both sides that they each knew when the
war was over and the hour of a lasting peace had struck. We may
admire the desperate daring of others who prefer annihilation to
compromise, but the palm of common sense, and, I will say, of
enlightened patriotism, belongs to the men like Grant and Lee, who
knew when they had fought enough for honor and for country.

So it came naturally about that in [^1]:[^8]:[^7]:[^6]:—the beginning of the second
century of the Republic—he began, by an election to Congress, his
political career. Thereafter for fourteen years this chamber was his
home. I use the word advisedly. Nowhere in the world was he so in
harmony with his environment as here; nowhere else did his mind
work with such full consciousness of its powers. The air of debate
was native to him; here he drank delight of battle with his peers. In
after days, when he drove by this stately pile, or when on rare
occasions his duty called him here, he greeted his old haunts with
the affectionate zest of a child of the house; during all the last ten
years of his life, filled as they were with activity and glory, he never
ceased to be homesick for this hall. When he came to the presidency,
there was not a day when his congressional service was not of use to
him. Probably no other president has been in such full and cordial
communion with Congress, if we may except Lincoln alone.
McKinley knew the legislative body thoroughly, its composition, its
methods, its habit of thought. He had the profoundest respect for its
authority and an inflexible belief in the ultimate rectitude of its
purposes. Our history shows how surely an executive courts disaster
and ruin by assuming an attitude of hostility or distrust to the
Legislature; and, on the other hand, McKinley's frank and sincere
trust and confidence in Congress were repaid by prompt and loyal
support and coöperation. During his entire term of office this mutual
trust and regard—so essential to the public welfare—was never
shadowed by a single cloud.

When he came to the presidency he confronted a situation of the
utmost difficulty, which might well have appalled a man of less
serene and tranquil self-confidence. There had been a state of
profound commercial and industrial depression from which his
friends had said his election would relieve the country. Our relations
with the outside world left much to be desired. The feeling between
the Northern and Southern sections of the Union was lacking in the
cordiality which was necessary to the welfare of both. Hawaii had
asked for annexation and had been rejected by the preceding
administration. There was a state of things in the Caribbean which
could not permanently endure. Our neighbor's house was on fire, and
there were grave doubts as to our rights and duties in the premises. A
man either weak or rash, either irresolute or headstrong, might have

brought ruin on himself and incalculable harm to the country.

The least desirable form of glory to a man of his habitual mood and
temper—that of successful war—was nevertheless conferred upon
him by uncontrollable events. He felt it must come; he deplored its
necessity; he strained almost to breaking his relations with his
friends, in order, first to prevent and then to postpone it to the latest
possible moment. But when the die was cast, he labored with the
utmost energy and ardor, and with an intelligence in military matters
which showed how much of the soldier still survived in the mature
statesman, to push forward the war to a decisive close. War was an
anguish to him; he wanted it short and conclusive. His merciful zeal
communicated itself to his subordinates, and the war, so long
dreaded, whose consequences were so momentous, ended in a
hundred days.

Mr. McKinley was reelected by an overwhelming majority. There
had been little doubt of the result among well-informed people, but
when it was known, a profound feeling of relief and renewal of trust
were evident among the leaders of capital and industry, not only in
this country, but everywhere. They felt that the immediate future
was secure, and that trade and commerce might safely push forward
in every field of effort and enterprise.

He felt that the harvest time was come, to garner in the fruits of so
much planting and culture, and he was determined that nothing he
might do or say should be liable to the reproach of a personal
interest. Let us say frankly he was a party man; he believed the
policies advocated by him and his friends counted for much in the
country's progress and prosperity. He hoped in his second term to
accomplish substantial results in the development and affirmation of
those policies. I spent a day with him shortly before he started on his
fateful journey to Buffalo. Never had I seen him higher in hope and
patriotic confidence. He was gratified to the heart that we had
arranged a treaty which gave us a free hand in the Isthmus. In fancy
he saw the canal already built and the argosies of the world passing
through it in peace and amity. He saw in the immense evolution of
American trade the fulfilment of all his dreams, the reward of all his
labors. He was, I need not say, an ardent protectionist, never more
sincere and devoted than during those last days of his life. He

regarded reciprocity as the bulwark of protection—not a breach, but
a fulfilment of the law. The treaties which for four years had been
preparing under his personal supervision he regarded as ancillary to
the general scheme. He was opposed to any revolutionary plan of
change in the existing legislation; he was careful to point out that
everything he had done was in faithful compliance with the law
itself.

In that mood of high hope, of generous expectation, he went to
Buffalo, and there, on the threshold of eternity, he delivered that
memorable speech, worthy for its loftiness of tone, its blameless
morality, its breadth of view, to be regarded as his testament to the
nation. Through all his pride of country and his joy of its success
runs the note of solemn warning, as in Kipling's noble hymn, "Lest
We Forget."

The next day sped the bolt of doom, and for a week after—in an
agony of dread, broken by illusive glimpses of hope that our prayers
might be answered—the nation waited for the end. Nothing in the
glorious life we saw gradually waning was more admirable and
exemplary than its close. The gentle humanity of his words when he
saw his assailant in danger of summary vengeance, "Do not let them
hurt him;" his chivalrous care that the news should be broken gently
to his wife; the fine courtesy with which he apologized for the
damage which his death would bring to the great Exhibition; and the
heroic resignation of his final words, "It is God's way; His will, not
ours, be done," were all the instinctive expressions of a nature so
lofty and so pure that pride in its nobility at once softened and
enhanced the nation's sense of loss. The Republic grieved over such
a son,—but is proud forever of having produced him. After all, in
spite of its tragic ending, his life was extraordinarily happy. He had,
all his days, troops of friends, the cheer of fame and fruitful labor;
and he became at last,

```
"On fortune's crowning slope,
The pillar of a people's hope,
The center of a world's desire."

I offer no apology for speaking upon a religious theme, for it is the
most universal of all themes. I am interested in the science of
government, but I am interested more in religion than in
government. I enjoy making a political speech—I have made a good
many and shall make more—but I would rather speak on religion
than on politics. I commenced speaking on the stump when I was
only twenty, but I commenced speaking in the church six years
earlier—and I shall be in the church even after I am put of politics. I
feel sure of my ground when I make a political speech, but I feel
even more certain of my ground when I make a religious speech. If I
addrest you upon the subject of law I might interest the lawyers; if I
discust the science of medicine I might interest the physicians; in
like manner merchants might be interested in comments on
commerce, and farmers in matters pertaining to agriculture; but no
one of these subjects appeals to all. Even the science of government,
tho broader than any profession or occupation, does not embrace the
whole sum of life, and those who think upon it differ so among
themselves that I could not speak upon the subject so as to please a
part of the audience without displeasing others. While to me the
science of government is intensely absorbing, I recognize that the
most important things in life lie outside of the realm of government
and that more depends upon what the individual does for himself
than upon what the government does or can do for him. Men can be
miserable under the best government and they can be happy under
the worst government.

Government affects but a part of the life which we live here and
does not deal at all with the life beyond, while religion touches the
infinite circle of existence as well as the small arc of that circle
which we spend on earth. No greater theme, therefore, can engage
our attention. If I discuss questions of government I must secure the
coöperation of a majority before I can put my ideas into practise, but
if, in speaking on religion, I can touch one human heart for good, I
have not spoken in vain no matter how large the majority may be
against me.

Man is a religious being; the heart instinctively seeks for a God.
Whether he worships on the banks of the Ganges, prays with his face
upturned to the sun, kneels toward Mecca or, regarding all space as a
temple, communes with the Heavenly Father according to the
Christian creed, man is essentially devout.

There are honest doubters whose sincerity we recognize and respect,
but occasionally I find young men who think it smart to be skeptical;
they talk as if it were an evidence of larger intelligence to scoff at
creeds and to refuse to connect themselves with churches. They call
themselves "Liberal," as if a Christian were narrow minded. Some
go so far as to assert that the "advanced thought of the world" has
discarded the idea that there is a God. To these young men I desire to
address myself.

Even some older people profess to regard religion as a superstition,
pardonable in the ignorant but unworthy of the educated. Those who
hold this view look down with mild contempt upon such as give to
religion a definite place in their thoughts and lives. They assume an
intellectual superiority and often take little pains to conceal the
assumption. Tolstoy administers to the "cultured crowd" (the words
quoted are his) a severe rebuke when he declares that the religious
sentiment rests not upon a superstitious fear of the invisible forces of
nature, but upon man's consciousness of his finiteness amid an
infinite universe and of his sinfulness; and this consciousness, the
great philosopher adds, man can never outgrow. Tolstoy is right;
man recognizes how limited are his own powers and how vast is the
universe, and he leans upon the arm that _is_ stronger than his. Man
feels the weight of his sins and looks for One who is sinless.

Religion has been defined by Tolstoy as the relation which man fixes
between himself and his God, and morality as the outward
manifestation of this inward relation. Every one, by the time he
reaches maturity, has fixt some relation between himself and God
and no material change in this relation can take place without a
revolution in the man, for this relation is the most potent influence
that acts upon a human life.

Religion is the foundation of morality in the individual and in the
group of individuals. Materialists have attempted to build up a

system of morality upon the basis of enlightened self-interest. They
would have man figure out by mathematics that it pays him to
abstain from wrong-doing; they would even inject an element of
selfishness into altruism, but the moral system elaborated by the
materialists has several defects. First, its virtues are borrowed from
moral systems based upon religion. All those who are intelligent
enough to discuss a system of morality are so saturated with the
morals derived from systems resting upon religion that they cannot
frame a system resting upon reason alone. Second, as it rests upon
argument rather than upon authority, the young are not in a position
to accept or reject. Our laws do not permit a young man to dispose
of real estate until he is twenty-one. Why this restraint? Because his
reason is not mature; and yet a man's life is largely moulded by the
environment of his youth. Third, one never knows just how much of
his decision is due to reason and how much is due to passion or to
selfish interest. Passion can dethrone the reason—we recognize this
in our criminal laws. We also recognize the bias of self-interest when
we exclude from the jury every man, no matter how reasonable or
upright he may be, who has a pecuniary interest in the result of the
trial. And, fourth, one whose morality rests upon a nice calculation
of benefits to be secured spends time figuring that he should spend
in action. Those who keep a book account of their good deeds
seldom do enough good to justify keeping books. A noble life cannot
be built upon an arithmetic; it must be rather like the spring that
pours forth constantly of that which refreshes and invigorates.

Morality is the power of endurance in man; and a religion which
teaches personal responsibility to God gives strength to morality.
There is a powerful restraining influence in the belief that an all-
seeing eye scrutinizes every thought and word and act of the
individual.

There is wide difference between the man who is trying to conform
his life to a standard of morality about him and the man who seeks
to make his life approximate to a divine standard. The former
attempts to live up to the standard, if it is above him, and down to it,
if it is below him—and if he is doing right only when others are
looking he is sure to find a time when he thinks he is unobserved,
and then he takes a vacation and falls. One needs the inner strength

which comes with the conscious presence of a personal God. If those
who are thus fortified sometimes yield to temptation, how helpless
and hopeless must those be who rely upon their own strength alone!

There are difficulties to be encountered in religion, but there are
difficulties to be encountered everywhere. If Christians sometimes
have doubts and fears, unbelievers have more doubts and greater
fears. I passed through a period of skepticism when I was in college
and I have been glad ever since that I became a member of the
church before I left home for college, for it helped me during those
trying days. And the college days cover the dangerous period in the
young man's life; he is just coming into possession of his powers,
and feels stronger than he ever feels afterward—and he thinks he
knows more than he ever does know.

It was at this period that I became confused by the different theories
of creation. But I examined these theories and found that they all
assumed something to begin with. You can test this for yourselves.
The nebular hypothesis, for instance, assumes that matter and force
existed—matter in particles infinitely fine and each particle
separated from every other particle by space infinitely great.
Beginning with this assumption, force working on matter—
according to this hypothesis—created a universe. Well, I have a right
to assume, and I prefer to assume, a Designer back of the design—a
Creator back of the creation; and no matter how long you draw out
the process of creation, so long as God stands back of it you cannot
shake my faith in Jehovah. In Genesis it is written that, in the
beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, and I can stand on
that proposition until I find some theory of creation that goes farther
back than "the beginning." We must begin with something—we
must start somewhere—and the Christian begins with God.

I do not carry the doctrine of evolution as far as some do; I am not
yet convinced that man is a lineal descendant of the lower animals. I
do not mean to find fault with you if you want to accept the theory;
all I mean to say is that while you may trace your ancestry back to
the monkey if you find pleasure or pride in doing so, you shall not
connect me with your family tree without more evidence than has
yet been produced. I object to the theory for several reasons. First, it
is a dangerous theory. If a man links himself in generations with the

monkey, it then becomes an important question whether he is going
toward him or coming from him—and I have seen them going in
both directions. I do not know of any argument that can be used to
prove that man is an improved monkey that may not be used just as
well to prove that the monkey is a degenerate man, and the latter
theory is more plausible than the former.

It is true that man, in some physical characteristics resembles the
beast, but man has a mind as well as a body, and a soul as well as a
mind. The mind is greater than the body and the soul is greater than
the mind, and I object to having man's pedigree traced on one-third
of him only—and that the lowest third. Fairbairn, in his "Philosophy
of Christianity," lays down a sound proposition when he says that it
is not sufficient to explain man as an animal; that it is necessary to
explain man in history—and the Darwinian theory does not do this.
The ape, according to this theory, is older than man and yet the ape
is still an ape while man is the author of the marvelous civilization
which we see about us.

One does not escape from mystery, however, by accepting this
theory, for it does not explain the origin of life. When the follower of
Darwin has traced the germ of life back to the lowest form in which
it appears—and to follow him one must exercise more faith than
religion calls for—he finds that scientists differ. Those who reject
the idea of creation are divided into two schools, some believing that
the first germ of life came from another planet and others holding
that it was the result of spontaneous generation. Each school answers
the arguments advanced by the other, and as they cannot agree with
each other, I am not compelled to agree with either.

If I were compelled to accept one of these theories I would prefer the
first, for if we can chase the germ of life off this planet and get it out
into space we can guess the rest of the way and no one can
contradict us, but if we accept the doctrine of spontaneous
generation we cannot explain why spontaneous generation ceased to
act after the first germ was created.

Go back as far as we may, we cannot escape from the creative act,
and it is just as easy for me to believe that God created man _as he is_
as to believe that, millions of years ago, He created a germ of life

and endowed it with power to develop into all that we see to-day. I
object to the Darwinian theory, until more conclusive proof is
produced, because I fear we shall lose the consciousness of God's
presence in our daily life, if we must accept the theory that through
all the ages no spiritual force has touched the life of man or shaped
the destiny of nations.

But there is another objection. The Darwinian theory represents man
as reaching his present perfection by the operation of the law of hate
—the merciless law by which the strong crowd out and kill off the
weak. If this is the law of our development then, if there is any logic
that can bind the human mind, we shall turn backward toward the
beast in proportion as we substitute the law of love. I prefer to
believe that love rather than hatred is the law of development. How
can hatred be the law of development when nations have advanced
in proportion as they have departed from that law and adopted the
law of love?

But, I repeat, while I do not accept the Darwinian theory I shall not
quarrel with you about it; I only refer to it to remind you that it does
not solve the mystery of life or explain human progress. I fear that
some have accepted it in the hope of escaping from the miracle, but
why should the miracle frighten us? And yet I am inclined to think
that it is one of the test questions with the Christian.

Christ cannot be separated from the miraculous; His birth, His
ministrations, and His resurrection, all involve the miraculous, and
the change which His religion works in the human heart is a
continuing miracle. Eliminate the miracles and Christ becomes
merely a human being and His gospel is stript of divine authority.

The miracle raises two questions: "Can God perform a miracle?"
and, "Would He want to?" The first is easy to answer. A God who
can make a world can do anything He wants to do with it. The power
to perform miracles is necessarily implied in the power to create.
But would God _want_ to perform a miracle?—this is the question
which has given most of the trouble. The more I have considered it
the less inclined I am to answer in the negative. To say that God
_would not_ perform a miracle is to assume a more intimate
knowledge of God's plans and purposes than I can claim to have. I

will not deny that God does perform a miracle or may perform one
merely because I do not know how or why He does it. I find it so
difficult to decide each day what God wants done now that I am not
presumptuous enough to attempt to declare what God might have
wanted to do thousands of years ago. The fact that we are constantly
learning of the existence of new forces suggests the possibility that
God may operate through forces yet unknown to us, and the
mysteries with which we deal every day warn me that faith is as
necessary as sight. Who would have credited a century ago the
stories that are now told of the wonder-working electricity? For ages
man had known the lightning, but only to fear it; now, this invisible
current is generated by a man-made machine, imprisoned in a man-
made wire and made to do the bidding of man. We are even able to
dispense with the wire and hurl words through space, and the X-ray
has enabled us to look through substances which were supposed,
until recently, to exclude all light. The miracle is not more
mysterious than many of the things with which man now deals—it is
simply different. The miraculous birth of Christ is not more
mysterious than any other conception—it is simply unlike it; nor is
the resurrection of Christ more mysterious than the myriad
resurrections which mark each annual seed-time.

It is sometimes said that God could not suspend one of His laws
without stopping the universe, but do we not suspend or overcome
the law of gravitation every day? Every time we move a foot or lift a
weight we temporarily overcome one of the most universal of
natural laws and yet the world is not disturbed.

Science has taught us so many things that we are tempted to
conclude that we know everything, but there is really a great
unknown which is still unexplored and that which we have learned
ought to increase our reverence rather than our egotism. Science has
disclosed some of the machinery of the universe, but science has not
yet revealed to us the great secret—the secret of life. It is to be found
in every blade of grass, in every insect, in every bird and in every
animal, as well as in man. Six thousand years of recorded history
and yet we know no more about the secret of life than they knew in
the beginning. We live, we plan; we have our hopes, our fears; and
yet in a moment a change may come over anyone of us and this

body will become a mass of lifeless clay. What is it that, having, we
live, and having not, we are as the clod? The progress of the race
and the civilization which we now behold are the work of men and
women who have not yet solved the mystery of their own lives.

And our food, must we understand it before we eat it? If we refused
to eat anything until we could understand the mystery of its growth,
we would die of starvation. But mystery does not bother us in the
dining-room; it is only in the church that it is a stumbling block.

I was eating a piece of watermelon some months ago and was struck
with its beauty. I took some of the seeds and dried them and weighed
them, and found that it would require some five thousand seeds to
weigh a pound; and then I applied mathematics to that forty-pound
melon. One of these seeds, put into the ground, when warmed by the
sun and moistened by the rain, takes off its coat and goes to work; it
gathers from somewhere two hundred thousand times its own
weight, and forcing this raw material through a tiny stem, constructs
a watermelon. It ornaments the outside with a covering of green;
inside the green it puts a layer of white, and within the white a core
of red, and all through the red it scatters seeds, each one capable of
continuing the work of reproduction. Where does that little seed get
its tremendous power? Where does it find its coloring matter? How
does it collect its flavoring extract? How does it build a watermelon?
Until you can explain a watermelon, do not be too sure that you can
set limits to the power of the Almighty and say just what He would
do or how He would do it. I cannot explain the watermelon, but I eat
it and enjoy it.

The egg is the most universal of foods and its use dates from the
beginning, but what is more mysterious than an egg? When an egg is
fresh it is an important article of merchandise; a hen can destroy its
market value in a week's time, but in two weeks more she can bring
forth from it what man could not find in it. We eat eggs, but we
cannot explain an egg.

Water has been used from the birth of man; we learned after it had
been used for ages that it is merely a mixture of gases, but it is far
more important that we have water to drink than that we know that it
is not water.

Everything that grows tells a like story of infinite power. Why
should I deny that a divine hand fed a multitude with a few loaves
and fishes when I see hundreds of millions fed every year by a hand
which converts the seeds scattered over the field into an abundant
harvest? We know that food can be multiplied in a few months' time;
shall we deny the power of the Creator to eliminate the element of
time, when we have gone so far in eliminating the element of space?
Who am I that I should attempt to measure the arm of the Almighty
with my puny arm, or to measure the brain of the Infinite with my
finite mind? Who am I that I should attempt to put metes and bounds
to the power of the Creator?

But there is something even more wonderful still—the mysterious
change that takes place in the human heart when the man begins to
hate the things he loved and to love the things he hated—the
marvelous transformation that takes place in the man who, before
the change, would have sacrificed a world for his own advancement
but who, after the change, would give his life for a principle and
esteem it a privilege to make sacrifice for his convictions! What
greater miracle than this, that converts a selfish, self-centered human
being into a center from which good influences flow out in every
direction! And yet this miracle has been wrought in the heart of each
one of us—or may be wrought—and we have seen it wrought in the
hearts and lives of those about us. No, living a life that is a mystery,
and living in the midst of mystery and miracles, I shall not allow
either to deprive me of the benefits of the Christian religion. If you
ask me if I understand everything in the Bible, I answer, no, but if
we will try to live up to what we do understand, we will be kept so
busy doing good that we will not have time to worry about the
passages which we do not understand.

Some of those who question the miracle also question the theory of
atonement; they assert that it does not accord with their idea of
justice for one to die for all. Let each one bear his own sins and the
punishments due for them, they say. The doctrine of vicarious
suffering is not a new one; it is as old as the race. That one should
suffer for others is one of the most familiar of principles and we see
the principle illustrated every day of our lives. Take the family, for
instance; from the day the mother's first child is born, for twenty or

thirty years her children are scarcely out of her waking thoughts. Her
life trembles in the balance at each child's birth; she sacrifices for
them, she surrenders herself to them. Is it because she expects them
to pay her back? Fortunate for the parent and fortunate for the child
if the latter has an opportunity to repay in part the debt it owes. But
no child can compensate a parent for a parent's care. In the course of
nature the debt is paid, not to the parent, but to the next generation,
and the next—each generation suffering, sacrificing for and
surrendering itself to the generation that follows. This is the law of
our lives.

Nor is this confined to the family. Every step in civilization has been
made possible by those who have been willing to sacrifice for
posterity. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of
conscience and free government have all been won for the world by
those who were willing to labor unselfishly for their fellows. So well
established is this doctrine that we do not regard anyone as great
unless he recognizes how unimportant his life is in comparison with
the problems with which he deals.

I find proof that man was made in the image of his Creator in the
fact that, throughout the centuries, man has been willing to die, if
necessary, that blessings denied to him might be enjoyed by his
children, his children's children and the world.

The seeming paradox: "He that saveth his life shall lose it and he
that loseth his life for my sake shall find it," has an application wider
than that usually given to it; it is an epitome of history. Those who
live only for themselves live little lives, but those who stand ready to
give themselves for the advancement of things greater than
themselves find a larger life than the one they would have
surrendered. Wendell Phillips gave expression to the same idea when
he said, "What imprudent men the benefactors of the race have been.
How prudently most men sink into nameless graves, while now and
then a few _forget_ themselves into immortality." We win immortality,
not by remembering ourselves, but by forgetting ourselves in
devotion to things larger than ourselves.

Instead of being an unnatural plan, the plan of salvation is in perfect
harmony with human nature as we understand it. Sacrifice is the

language of love, and Christ, in suffering for the world, adopted the
only means of reaching the heart. This can be demonstrated not only
by theory but by experience, for the story of His life, His teachings,
His sufferings and His death has been translated into every language
and everywhere it has touched the heart.

But if I were going to present an argument in favor of the divinity of
Christ, I would not begin with miracles or mystery or with the theory
of atonement. I would begin as Carnegie Simpson does in his book
entitled, "The Fact of Christ." Commencing with the undisputed fact
that Christ lived, he points out that one cannot contemplate this fact
without feeling that in some way it is related to those now living. He
says that one can read of Alexander, of Cæsar or of Napoleon, and
not feel that it is a matter of personal concern; but that when one
reads that Christ lived, and how He lived and how He died, he feels
that somehow there is a cord that stretches from that life to his. As
he studies the character of Christ he becomes conscious of certain
virtues which stand out in bold relief—His purity, His forgiving
spirit, and His unfathomable love. The author is correct, Christ
presents an example of purity in thought and life, and man,
conscious of his own imperfections and grieved over his
shortcomings, finds inspiration in the fact that He was tempted in all
points like as we are, and yet without sin. I am not sure but that each
can find just here a way of determining for himself whether he
possesses the true spirit of a Christian. If the sinlessness of Christ
inspires within him an earnest desire to conform his life more nearly
to the perfect example, he is indeed a follower; if, on the other hand,
he resents the reproof which the purity of Christ offers, and refuses
to mend his ways, he has yet to be born again.

The most difficult of all the virtues to cultivate is the forgiving spirit.
Revenge seems to be natural with man; it is human to want to get
even with an enemy. It has even been popular to boast of
vindictiveness; it was once inscribed on a man's monument that he
had repaid both friends and enemies more than he had received. This
was not the spirit of Christ. He taught forgiveness and in that
incomparable prayer which He left as model for our petitions, He
made our willingness to forgive the measure by which we may claim
forgiveness. He not only taught forgiveness but He exemplified His

teachings in His life. When those who persecuted Him brought Him
to the most disgraceful of all deaths, His spirit of forgiveness rose
above His sufferings and He prayed, "Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do!"

But love is the foundation of Christ's creed. The world had known
love before; parents had loved their children, and children their
parents; husbands had loved their wives, and wives their husbands;
and friend had loved friend; but Jesus gave a new definition of love.
His love was as wide as the sea; its limits were so far-flung that even
an enemy could not travel beyond its bounds. Other teachers sought
to regulate the lives of their followers by rule and formula, but
Christ's plan was to purify the heart and then to leave love to direct
the footsteps.

What conclusion is to be drawn from the life, the teachings and the
death of this historic figure? Reared in a carpenter shop; with no
knowledge of literature, save Bible literature; with no acquaintance
with philosophers living or with the writings of sages dead, when
only about thirty years old He gathered disciples about Him,
promulgated a higher code of morals than the world had ever known
before, and proclaimed Himself the Messiah. He taught and
performed miracles for a few brief months and then was crucified;
His disciples were scattered and many of them put to death; His
claims were disputed, His resurrection denied and His followers
persecuted; and yet from this beginning His religion spread until
hundreds of millions have taken His name with reverence upon their
lips and millions have been willing to die rather than surrender the
faith which He put into their hearts. How shall we account for Him?
Here is the greatest fact of history; here is One who has with
increasing power, for nineteen hundred years, moulded the hearts,
the thoughts and the lives of men, and He exerts more influence to-
day than ever before. "What think ye of Christ?" It is easier to
believe Him divine than to explain in any other way what he said
and did and was. And I have greater faith, even than before, since I
have visited the Orient and witnessed the successful contest which
Christianity is waging against the religions and philosophies of the
East.

I was thinking a few years ago of the Christmas which was then

approaching and of Him in whose honor the day is celebrated. I
recalled the message, "Peace on earth, good will to men," and then
my thoughts ran back to the prophecy uttered centuries before His
birth, in which He was described as the Prince of Peace. To reinforce
my memory I re-read the prophecy and I found immediately
following a verse which I had forgotten—a verse which declares that
of the increase of His peace and government there shall be no end,
And, Isaiah adds, that He shall judge His people with justice and
with judgment. I had been reading of the rise and fall of nations, and
occasionally I had met a gloomy philosopher who preached the
doctrine that nations, like individuals, must of necessity have their
birth, their infancy, their maturity and finally their decay and death.
But here I read of a government that is to be perpetual—a
government of increasing peace and blessedness—the government
of the Prince of Peace—and it is to rest on justice. I have thought of
this prophecy many times during the last few years, and I have
selected this theme that I might present some of the reasons which
lead me to believe that Christ has fully earned the right to be called
The Prince of Peace—a title that will in the years to come be more
and more applied to Him. If he can bring peace to each individual
heart, and if His creed when applied will bring peace throughout the
earth, who will deny His right to be called the Prince of Peace?

All the world is in search of peace; every heart that ever beat has
sought for peace, and many have been the methods employed to
secure it. Some have thought to purchase it with riches and have
labored to secure wealth, hoping to find peace when they were able
to go where they pleased and buy what they liked. Of those who
have endeavored to purchase peace with money, the large majority
have failed to secure the money. But what has been the experience of
those who have been eminently successful in finance? They all tell
the same story, viz., that they spent the first half of their lives trying
to get money from others and the last half trying to keep others from
getting their money, and that they found peace in neither half. Some
have even reached the point where they find difficulty in getting
people to accept their money; and I know of no better indication of
the ethical awakening in this country than the increasing tendency to
scrutinize the methods of money-making. I am sanguine enough to
believe that the time will yet come when respectability will no

longer be sold to great criminals by helping them to spend their ill-
gotten gains. A long step in advance will have been taken when
religious, educational and charitable institutions refuse to condone
conscienceless methods in business and leave the possessor of
illegitimate accumulations to learn how lonely life is when one
prefers money to morals.

Some have sought peace in social distinction, but whether they have
been within the charmed circle and fearful lest they might fall out, or
outside, and hopeful that they might get in, they have not found
peace. Some have thought, vain thought, to find peace in political
prominence; but whether office comes by birth, as in monarchies, or
by election, as in republics, it does not bring peace. An office is not
considered a high one if all can occupy it. Only when few in a
generation can hope to enjoy an honor do we call it a great honor. I
am glad that our Heavenly Father did not make the peace of the
human heart to depend upon our ability to buy it with money, secure
it in society, or win it at the polls, for in either case but few could
have obtained it, but when He made peace the reward of a
conscience void of offense toward God and man, He put it within the
reach of all. The poor can secure it as easily as the rich, the social
outcasts as freely as the leader of society, and the humblest citizen
equally with those who wield political power.

To those who have grown gray in the Church, I need not speak of the
peace to be found in faith in God and trust in an overruling
Providence. Christ taught that our lives are precious in the sight of
God, and poets have taken up the thought and woven it into
immortal verse. No uninspired writer has exprest it more beautifully
than William Cullen Bryant in his Ode to a Waterfowl. After
following the wanderings of the bird of passage as it seeks first its
southern and then its northern home, he concludes:

```
Thou art gone; the abyss of heaven
Hath swallowed up thy form, but on my
heart
Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given,
And shall not soon depart.
```

```
He who, from zone to zone,
Guides through the boundless sky thy certain
flight,
In the long way that I must tread alone,
Will lead my steps aright.
```

Christ promoted peace by giving us assurance that a line of
communication can be established between the Father above and the
child below. And who will measure the consolations of the hour of
prayer?

And immortality! Who will estimate the peace which a belief in a
future life has brought to the sorrowing hearts of the sons of men?
You may talk to the young about death ending all, for life is full and
hope is strong, but preach not this doctrine to the mother who stands
by the death-bed of her babe or to one who is within the shadow of a
great affliction. When I was a young man I wrote to Colonel
Ingersoll and asked him for his views on God and immortality. His
secretary answered that the great infidel was not at home, but
enclosed a copy of a speech of Col. Ingersoll's which covered my
question. I scanned it with eagerness and found that he had exprest
himself about as follows: "I do not say that there is no God, I simply
say I do not know. I do not say that there is no life beyond the grave,
I simply say I do not know." And from that day to this I have asked
myself the question and have been unable to answer it to my own
satisfaction, how could anyone find pleasure in taking from a human
heart a living faith and substituting therefor the cold and cheerless
doctrine, "I do not know."

Christ gave us proof of immortality and it was a welcome assurance,
altho it would hardly seem necessary that one should rise from the
dead to convince us that the grave is not the end. To every created
thing God has given a tongue that proclaims a future life.

If the Father deigns to touch with divine power the cold and
pulseless heart of the buried acorn and to make it burst forth from its
prison walls, will he leave neglected in the earth the soul of man,
made in the image of his Creator? If he stoops to give to the rose
bush, whose withered blossoms float upon the autumn breeze, the
sweet assurance of another springtime, will He refuse the words of
hope to the sons of men when the frosts of winter come? If matter,
mute and inanimate, tho changed by the forces of nature into a
multitude of forms, can never die, will the imperial spirit of man
suffer annihilation when it has paid a brief visit like a royal guest to
this tenement of clay? No, I am sure that He who, notwithstanding
his apparent prodigality, created nothing without a purpose, and
wasted not a single atom in all his creation, has made provision for a
future life in which man's universal longing for immortality will find
its realization. I am as sure that we live again as I am sure that we
live to-day.

In Cairo I secured a few grains of wheat that had slumbered for more
than thirty centuries in an Egyptian tomb. As I looked at them this
thought came into my mind: If one of those grains had been planted
on the banks of the Nile the year after it grew, and all its lineal
descendants had been planted and replanted from that time until
now, its progeny would to-day be sufficiently numerous to feed the
teeming millions of the world. An unbroken chain of life connects
the earliest grains of wheat with the grains that we sow and reap.
There is in the grain of wheat an invisible something which has
power to discard the body that we see, and from earth and air
fashion a new body so much like the old one that we cannot tell the
one from the other. If this invisible germ of life in the grain of wheat
can thus pass unimpaired through three thousand resurrections, I
shall not doubt that my soul has power to clothe itself with a body
suited to its new existence when this earthly frame has crumbled into
dust.

A belief in immortality not only consoles the individual, but it exerts
a powerful influence in bringing peace between individuals. If one
actually thinks that man dies as the brute dies, he will yield more
easily to the temptation to do injustice to his neighbor when the
circumstances are such as to promise security from detection. But if

one really expects to meet again, and live eternally with, those
whom he knows to-day, he is restrained from evil deeds by the fear
of endless remorse. We do not know what rewards are in store for us
or what punishments may be reserved, but if there were no other it
would be some punishment for one who deliberately and
consciously wrongs another to have to live forever in the company
of the person wronged and have his littleness and selfishness laid
bare. I repeat, a belief in immortality must exert a powerful
influence in establishing justice between men and thus laying the
foundation for peace.

Again, Christ deserves to be called The Prince of Peace because He
has given us a measure of greatness which promotes peace. When
His disciples quarreled among themselves as to which should be
greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven, He rebuked them and said: "Let
him who would be chiefest among you be the servant of all." Service
is the measure of greatness; it always has been true; it is true to-day,
and it always will be true, that he is greatest who does the most of
good. And how this old world will be transformed when this
standard of greatness becomes the standard of every life! Nearly all
of our controversies and combats grow out of the fact that we are
trying to get something from each other—there will be peace when
our aim is to do something for each other. Our enmities and
animosities arise largely from our efforts to get as much as possible
out of the world—there will be peace when our endeavor is to put as
much as possible into the world. The human measure of a human life
is its income; the divine measure of a life is its outgo, its overflow—
its contribution to the welfare of all.

Christ also led the way to peace by giving us a formula for the
propagation of truth. Not all of those who have really desired to do
good have employed the Christian method—not all Christians even.
In the history of the human race but two methods have been used.
The first is the forcible method, and it has been employed most
frequently. A man has an idea which he thinks is good; he tells his
neighbors about it and they do not like it. This makes him angry; he
thinks it would be so much better for them if they would like it, and,
seizing a club, he attempts to make them like it. But one trouble
about this rule is that it works both ways; when a man starts out to

compel his neighbors to think as he does, he generally finds them
willing to accept the challenge and they spend so much time in
trying to coerce each other that they have no time left to do each
other good.

The other is the Bible plan—"Be not overcome of evil but overcome
evil with good." And there is no other way of overcoming evil. I am
not much of a farmer—I get more credit for my farming than I
deserve, and my little farm receives more advertising than it is
entitled to. But I am farmer enough to know that if I cut down weeds
they will spring up again; and farmer enough to know that if I plant
something there which has more vitality than the weeds I shall not
only get rid of the constant cutting, but have the benefit of the crop
besides.

In order that there might be no mistake in His plan of propagating
the truth, Christ went into detail and laid emphasis upon the value of
example—"So live that others seeing your good works may be
constrained to glorify your Father which is in Heaven." There is no
human influence so potent for good as that which goes out from an
upright life. A sermon may be answered; the arguments presented in
a speech may be disputed, but no one can answer a Christian life—it
is the unanswerable argument in favor of our religion.

It may be a slow process—this conversion of the world by the silent
influence of a noble example—but it is the only sure one, and the
doctrine applies to nations as well as to individuals. The Gospel of
the Prince of Peace gives us the only hope that the world has—and it
is an increasing hope—of the substitution of reason for the
arbitrament of force in the settlement of international disputes. And
our nation ought not to wait for other nations—it ought to take the
lead and prove its faith in the omnipotence of truth.

But Christ has given us a platform so fundamental that it can be
applied successfully to all controversies. We are interested in
platforms; we attend conventions, sometimes traveling long
distances; we have wordy wars over the phraseology of various
planks, and then we wage earnest campaigns to secure the
endorsement of these platforms at the polls. The platform given to
the world by The Prince of Peace is more far-reaching and more

comprehensive than any platform ever written by the convention of
any party in any country. When He condensed into one
commandment those of the ten which relate to man's duty toward his
fellows and enjoined upon us the rule, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor
as thyself," He presented a plan for the solution of all the problems
that now vex society or may hereafter arise. Other remedies may
palliate or postpone the day of settlement, but this is all-sufficient
and the reconciliation which it effects is a permanent one.

My faith in the future—and I have faith—and my optimism—for I
am an optimist—my faith and my optimism rest upon the belief that
Christ's teachings are being more studied to-day than ever before,
and that with this larger study will come a larger application of those
teachings to the everyday life of the world, and to the questions with
which we deal. In former times when men read that Christ came "to
bring life and immortality to light," they placed the emphasis upon
immortality; now they are studying Christ's relation to human life.
People used to read the Bible to find out what it said of Heaven; now
they read it more to find what light it throws upon the pathway of to-
day. In former years many thought to prepare themselves for future
bliss by a life of seclusion here; we are learning that to follow in the
footsteps of the Master we must go about doing good. Christ
declared that He came that we might have life and have it more
abundantly. The world is learning that Christ came not to narrow
life, but to enlarge it—not to rob it of its joy, but to fill it to
overflowing with purpose, earnestness and happiness.

But this Prince of Peace promises not only peace but strength. Some
have thought His teachings fit only for the weak and the timid and
unsuited to men of vigor, energy and ambition. Nothing could be
farther from the truth. Only the man of faith can be courageous.
Confident that he fights on the side of Jehovah, he doubts not the
success of his cause. What matters it whether he shares in the shouts
of triumph? If every word spoken in behalf of truth has its influence
and every deed done for the right weighs in the final account, it is
immaterial to the Christian whether his eyes behold victory or
whether he dies in the midst of the conflict.

```
"Yea, tho thou lie upon the dust,
```

```
When they who helped thee flee in
fear,
Die full of hope and manly trust,
Like those who fell in battle here.
```

```
Another hand thy sword shall
wield,
Another hand the standard wave,
Till from the trumpet's mouth is
pealed,
The blast of triumph o'er thy
grave."
```

Only those who _believe_ attempt the seemingly impossible, and, by
attempting, prove that one, with God, can chase a thousand and that
two can put ten thousand to flight. I can imagine that the early
Christians who were carried into the coliseum to make a spectacle
for those more savage than the beasts, were entreated by their
doubting companions not to endanger their lives. But, kneeling in
the center of the arena, they prayed and sang until they were
devoured. How helpless they seemed, and, measured by every
human rule, how hopeless was their cause! And yet within a few
decades the power which they invoked proved mightier than the
legions of the emperor and the faith in which they died was
triumphant o'er all the land. It is said that those who went to mock at
their sufferings returned asking themselves, "What is it that can enter
into the heart of man and make him die as these die?" They were
greater conquerors in their death than they could have been had they
purchased life by a surrender of their faith.

What would have been the fate of the church if the early Christians
had had as little faith as many of our Christians of to-day? And if the
Christians of to-day had the faith of the martyrs, how long would it
be before the fulfilment of the prophecy that "every knee shall bow
and every tongue confess?"

I am glad that He, who is called the Prince of Peace—who can bring
peace to every troubled heart and whose teachings, exemplified in
life, will bring peace between man and man, between community
and community, between State and State, between nation and nation

throughout the world—I am glad that He brings courage as well as
peace so that those who follow Him may take up and each day
bravely do the duties that to that day fall.

As the Christian grows older he appreciates more and more the
completeness with which Christ satisfies the longings of the heart,
and, grateful for the peace which he enjoys and for the strength
which he has received, he repeats the words of the great scholar, Sir
William Jones:

```
"Before thy mystic altar, heavenly truth,
I kneel in manhood, as I knelt in youth,
Thus let me kneel, till this dull form
decay,
And life's last shade be brightened by
thy ray."

EULOGY OF WEBSTER
```

```
Delivered at Dartmouth College, July 27, 1853.
```

Webster possessed the element of an impressive character, inspiring
regard, trust and admiration, not unmingled with love. It had, I think,
intrinsically a charm such as belongs only to a good, noble, and
beautiful nature. In its combination with so much fame, so much
force of will, and so much intellect, it filled and fascinated the
imagination and heart. It was affectionate in childhood and youth,
and it was more than ever so in the few last months of his long life.
It is the universal testimony that he gave to his parents, in largest
measure, honor, love, obedience; that he eagerly appropriated the
first means which he could command to relieve the father from the
debts contracted to educate his brother and himself; that he selected
his first place of professional practice that he might soothe the
coming on of his old age.

Equally beautiful was his love of all his kindred and of all his
friends. When I hear him accused of selfishness, and a cold, bad

nature, I recall him lying sleepless all night, not without tears of
boyhood, conferring with Ezekiel how the darling desire of both
hearts should be compassed, and he, too, admitted to the precious
privileges of education; courageously pleading the cause of both
brothers in the morning; prevailing by the wise and discerning
affection of the mother; suspending his studies of the law, and
registering deeds and teaching school to earn the means, for both, of
availing themselves of the opportunity which the parental self-
sacrifice had placed within their reach; loving him through life,
mourning him when dead, with a love and a sorrow very wonderful,
passing the sorrow of woman; I recall the husband, the father of the
living and of the early departed, the friend, the counselor of many
years, and my heart grows too full and liquid for the refutation of
words.

His affectionate nature, craving ever friendship, as well as the
presence of kindred blood, diffused itself through all his private life,
gave sincerity to all his hospitalities, kindness to his eye, warmth to
the pressure of his hand, made his greatness and genius unbend
themselves to the playfulness of childhood, flowed out in graceful
memories indulged of the past or the dead, of incidents when life
was young and promised to be happy,—gave generous sketches of
his rivals,—the high contention now hidden by the handful of earth,
—hours passed fifty years ago with great authors, recalled for the
vernal emotions which then they made to live and revel in the soul.
And from these conversations of friendship, no man—no man, old
or young—went away to remember one word of profaneness, one
allusion of indelicacy, one impure thought, one unbelieving
suggestion, one doubt cast on the reality of virtue, of patriotism, of
enthusiasm, of the progress of man,—one doubt cast on
righteousness, or temperance, or judgment to come.

I have learned by evidence the most direct and satisfactory that in
the last months of his life, the whole affectionateness of his nature—
his consideration of others, his gentleness, his desire to make them
happy and to see them happy—seemed to come out in more and
more beautiful and habitual expressions than ever before. The long
day's public tasks were felt to be done; the cares, the uncertainties,
the mental conflicts of high place, were ended; and he came home to

recover himself for the few years which he might still expect would
be his before he should go hence to be here no more. And there, I am
assured and duly believe, no unbecoming regrets pursued him; no
discontent, as for injustice suffered or expectations unfulfilled; no
self-reproach for anything done or anything omitted by himself; no
irritation, no peevishness unworthy of his noble nature; but instead,
love and hope for his country, when she became the subject of
conversation, and for all around him, the dearest and most
indifferent, for all breathing things about him, the overflow of the
kindest heart growing in gentleness and benevolence—paternal,
patriarchal affections, seeming to become more natural, warm, and
communicative every hour. Softer and yet brighter grew the tints on
the sky of parting day; and the last lingering rays, more even than
the glories of noon, announced how divine was the source from
which they proceeded; how incapable to be quenched; how certain
to rise on a morning which no night should follow.

Such a character was made to be loved. It was loved. Those who
knew and saw it in its hour of calm—those who could repose on that
soft green—loved him. His plain neighbors loved him; and one said,
when he was laid in his grave, "How lonesome the world seems!"
Educated young men loved him. The ministers of the gospel, the
general intelligence of the country, the masses afar oft, loved him.
True, they had not found in his speeches, read by millions, so much
adulation of the people; so much of the music which robs the public
reason of itself; so many phrases of humanity and philanthropy; and
some had told them he was lofty and cold—solitary in his greatness;
but every year they came nearer and nearer to him, and as they came
nearer, they loved him better; they heard how tender the son had
been, the husband, the brother, the father, the friend, and neighbor;
that he was plain, simple, natural, generous, hospitable—the heart
larger than the brain; that he loved little children and reverenced
God, the Scriptures, the Sabbath-day, the Constitution, and the law
—and their hearts clave unto him. More truly of him than even of
the great naval darling of England might it be said that "his presence
would set the church bells ringing, and give schoolboys a holiday,
would bring children from school and old men from the chimney-
corner, to gaze on him ere he died." The great and unavailing
lamentations first revealed the deep place he had in the hearts of his

countrymen.

You are now to add to this his extraordinary power of influencing
the convictions of others by speech, and you have completed the
survey of the means of his greatness. And here, again I begin by
admiring an aggregate made up of excellences and triumphs,
ordinarily deemed incompatible. He spoke with consummate ability
to the bench, and yet exactly as, according to every sound canon of
taste and ethics, the bench ought to be addressed. He spoke with
consummate ability to the jury, and yet exactly as, according to
every sound canon, that totally different tribunal ought to be
addressed. In the halls of Congress, before the people assembled for
political discussion in masses, before audiences smaller and more
select, assembled for some solemn commemoration of the past or of
the dead—in each of these, again, his speech, of the first form of
ability, was exactly adapted, also, to the critical properties of the
place; each achieved, when delivered, the most instant and specific
success of eloquence—some of them in a splendid and remarkable
degree; and yet, stranger still, when reduced to writing, as they fell
from his lips, they compose a body of reading in many volumes—
solid, clear, rich, and full of harmony—a classical and permanent
political literature.

And yet all these modes of his eloquence, exactly adapted each to its
stage and its end, were stamped with his image and superscription,
identified by characteristics incapable to be counterfeited and
impossible to be mistaken. The same high power of reason, intent in
every one to explore and display some truth; some truth of judicial,
or historical, or biographical fact; some truth of law, deduced by
construction, perhaps, or by illation; some truth of policy, for want
whereof a nation, generations, may be the worse—reason seeking
and unfolding truth; the same tone, in all, of deep earnestness,
expressive of strong desire that what he felt to be important should
be accepted as true, and spring up to action; the same transparent,
plain, forcible, and direct speech, conveying his exact thought to the
mind—not something less or more; the same sovereignty of form, of
brow, and eye, and tone, and manner—everywhere the intellectual
king of men, standing before you—that same marvelousness of
qualities and results, residing, I know not where, in words, in

pictures, in the ordering of ideas, infelicities indescribable, by means
whereof, coming from his tongue, all things seemed mended—truth
seemed more true, probability more plausible, greatness more grand,
goodness more awful, every affection more tender than when
coming from other tongues—these are, in all, his eloquence.

But sometimes it became individualized and discriminated even
from itself; sometimes place and circumstances, great interests at
stake, a stage, an audience fitted for the highest historic action, a
crisis, personal or national, upon him, stirred the depths of that
emotional nature, as the anger of the goddess stirs the sea on which
the great epic is beginning; strong passions themselves kindled to
intensity, quickened every faculty to a new life; the stimulated
associations of ideas brought all treasures of thought and knowledge
within command; the spell, which often held his imagination fast,
dissolved, and she arose and gave him to choose of her urn of gold;
earnestness became vehemence, the simple, perspicuous, measured
and direct language became a headlong, full, and burning tide of
speech; the discourse of reason, wisdom, gravity, and beauty
changed to that superhuman, that rarest consummate eloquence—
grand, rapid, pathetic, terrible; the _aliquid immensum infinitumque_
that Cicero might have recognized; the master triumph of man in the
rarest opportunity of his noble power.

Such elevation above himself, in congressional debate, was most
uncommon. Some such there were in the great discussions of
executive power following the removal of the deposits, which they
who heard them will never forget, and some which rest in the
tradition of hearers only. But there were other fields of oratory on
which, under the influence of more uncommon springs of
inspiration, he exemplified, in still other forms, an eloquence in
which I do not know that he has had a superior among men.
Addressing masses by tens of thousands in the open air, on the
urgent political questions of the day, or designed to lead the
meditations of an hour devoted to the remembrance of some national
era, or of some incident marking the progress of the nation, and
lifting him up to a view of what is, and what is past, and some
indistinct revelation of the glory that lies in the future, or of some
great historical name, just borne by the nation to his tomb—we have

learned that then and there, at the base of Bunker Hill, before the
corner-stone was laid, and again when from the finished column the
centuries looked on him; in Faneuil Hall, mourning for those with
whose spoken or written eloquence of freedom its arches had so
often resounded; on the Rock of Plymouth; before the Capitol, of
which there shall not be one stone left on another before his memory
shall have ceased to live—in such scenes, unfettered by the laws of
forensic or parliamentary debate, multitudes uncounted lifting up
their eyes to him; some great historical scenes of America around;
all symbols of her glory and art and power and fortune there; voices
of the past, not unheard; shapes beckoning from the future, not
unseen—sometimes that mighty intellect, borne upward to a height
and kindled to an illumination which we shall see no more, wrought
out, as it were, in an instant a picture of vision, warning, prediction;
the progress of the nation; the contrasts of its eras; the heroic deaths;
the motives to patriotism; the maxims and arts imperial by which the
glory has been gathered and may be heightened—wrought out, in an
instant, a picture to fade only when all record of our mind shall die.

In looking over the public remains of his oratory, it is striking to
remark how, even in that most sober and massive understanding and
nature, you see gathered and expressed the characteristic sentiments
and the passing time of our America. It is the strong old oak which
ascends before you; yet our soil, our heaven, are attested in it as
perfectly as if it were a flower that could grow in no other climate
and in no other hour of the year or day. Let me instance in one thing
only. It is a peculiarity of some schools of eloquence that they
embody and utter, not merely the individual genius and character of
the speaker, but a national consciousness—a national era, a mood, a
hope, a dread, a despair—in which you listen to the spoken history
of the time. There is an eloquence of an expiring nation, such as
seems to sadden the glorious speech of Demosthenes; such as
breathes grand and gloomy from visions of the prophets of the last
days of Israel and Judah; such as gave a spell to the expression of
Grattan and of Kossuth—the sweetest, most mournful, most awful of
the words which man may utter, or which man may hear—the
eloquence of a perishing nation.

There is another eloquence, in which the national consciousness of a

young or renewed and vast strength, of trust in a dazzling certain and
limitless future, an inward glorying in victories yet to be won,
sounds out as by voice of clarion, challenging to contest for the
highest prize of earth; such as that in which the leader of Israel in its
first days holds up to the new nation the Land of Promise; such as
that which in the well-imagined speeches scattered by Livy over the
history of the "majestic series of victories" speaks the Roman
consciousness of growing aggrandizement which should subject the
world; such as that through which, at the tribunes of her revolution,
in the bulletins of her rising soldiers, France told to the world her
dream of glory.

And of this kind somewhat is ours—cheerful, hopeful, trusting, as
befits youth and spring; the eloquence of a state beginning to ascend
to the first class of power, eminence, and consideration, and
conscious of itself. It is to no purpose that they tell you it is in bad
taste; that it partakes of arrogance and vanity; that a true national
good breeding would not know, or seem to know, whether the nation
is old or young; whether the tides of being are in their flow or ebb;
whether these coursers of the sun are sinking slowly to rest, wearied
with a journey of a thousand years, or just bounding from the Orient
unbreathed. Higher laws than those of taste determine the
consciousness of nations. Higher laws than those of taste determine
the general forms of the expression of that consciousness. Let the
downward age of America find its orators and poets and artists to
erect its spirit, or grace and soothe its dying; be it ours to go up with
Webster to the Rock, the Monument, the Capitol, and bid "the
distant generations hail!"

Until the seventh day of March, [^1]:[^8]:[^5]:[^0]:, I think it would have been
accorded to him by an almost universal acclaim, as general and as
expressive of profound and intelligent conviction and of enthusiasm,
love, and trust, as ever saluted conspicuous statesmanship, tried by
many crises of affairs in a great nation, agitated ever by parties, and
wholly free.

Delivered as Temporary Chairman of Progressive
National Convention, Chicago, Ill., June, 1911.

We stand for a nobler America. We stand for an undivided Nation.
We stand for a broader liberty, a fuller justice. We stand for a social
brotherhood as against savage individualism. We stand for an
intelligent coöperation instead of a reckless competition. We stand
for mutual helpfulness instead of mutual hatred. We stand for equal
rights as a fact of life instead of a catch-word of politics. We stand
for the rule of the people as a practical truth instead of a meaningless
pretense. We stand for a representative government that represents
the people. We battle for the actual rights of man.

To carry out our principles we have a plain program of constructive
reform. We mean to tear down only that which is wrong and out of
date; and where we tear down we mean to build what is right and
fitted to the times. We harken to the call of the present. We mean to
make laws fit conditions as they are and meet the needs of the
people who are on earth to-day. That we may do this we found a
party through which all who believe with us can work with us; or,
rather, we declare our allegiance to the party which the people
themselves have founded.

For this party comes from the grass roots. It has grown from the soil
of the people's hard necessities. It has the vitality of the people's
strong convictions. The people have work to be done and our party
is here to do that work. Abuse will only strengthen it, ridicule only
hasten its growth, falsehood only speed its victory. For years this
party has been forming. Parties exist for the people; not the people
for parties. Yet for years the politicians have made the people do the
work of the parties instead of the parties doing the work of the
people—and the politicians own the parties. The people vote for one
party and find their hopes turned to ashes on their lips; and then to
punish that party, they vote for the other party. So it is that partisan
victories have come to be merely the people's vengeance; and
always the secret powers have played their game.

Like other free people, most of us Americans are progressive or
reactionary, liberal or conservative. The neutrals do not count. Yet
to-day neither of the old parties is either wholly progressive or

wholly reactionary. Democratic politicians and office seekers say to
reactionary Democratic voters that the Democratic party is
reactionary enough to express reactionary views; and they say to
progressive Democrats that the Democratic party is progressive
enough _to_ express progressive views. At the same time, Republican
politicians and office seekers say the same thing about the
Republican party to progressive and reactionary Republican voters.

Sometimes in both Democratic and Republican States the
progressives get control of the party locally and then the
reactionaries recapture the same party in the same State; or this
process is reversed. So there is no nation-wide unity of principle in
either party, no stability of purpose, no clear-cut and sincere program
of one party at frank and open war with an equally clear-cut and
sincere program of an opposing party.

This unintelligent tangle is seen in Congress. Republican and
Democratic Senators and Representatives, believing alike on broad
measures affecting the whole Republic, find it hard to vote together
because of the nominal difference of their party membership. When,
sometimes, under resistless conviction, they do vote together, we
have this foolish spectacle: legislators calling themselves
Republicans and Democrats support the same policy, the Democratic
legislators declaring that that policy is Democratic and Republican
legislators declaring that it is Republican; and at the very same time
other Democratic and Republican legislators oppose that very same
policy, each of them declaring that it is not Democratic or not
Republican.

The condition makes it impossible most of the time, and hard at any
time, for the people's legislators who believe in the same broad
policies to enact them into logical, comprehensive laws. It confuses
the public mind. It breeds suspicion and distrust. It enables such
special interests as seek unjust gain at the public expense to get what
they want. It creates and fosters the degrading boss system in
American politics through which these special interests work.

This boss system is unknown and impossible under any other free
government in the world. In its very nature it is hostile to general
welfare. Yet it has grown until it now is a controlling influence in

American public affairs. At the present moment notorious bosses are
in the saddle of both old parties in various important States which
must be carried to elect a President. This Black Horse Cavalry is the
most important force in the practical work of the Democratic and
Republican parties in the present campaign. Neither of the old
parties' nominees for President can escape obligation to these old-
party bosses or shake their practical hold on many and powerful
members of the National Legislature.

Under this boss system, no matter which party wins, the people
seldom win; but the bosses almost always win. And they never work
for the people. They do not even work for the party to which they
belong. They work only for those anti-public interests whose
political employees they are. It is these interests that are the real
victors in the end.

These special interests which suck the people's substance are bi-
partisan. They use both parties. They are the invisible government
behind our visible government. Democratic and Republican bosses
alike are brother officers of this hidden power. No matter how
fiercely they pretend to fight one another before election, they work
together after election. And, acting so, this political conspiracy is
able to delay, mutilate or defeat sound and needed laws for the
people's welfare and the prosperity of honest business and even to
enact bad laws, hurtful to the people's welfare and oppressive to
honest business.

It is this invisible government which is the real danger to American
institutions. Its crude work at Chicago in June, which the people
were able to see, was no more wicked than its skillful work
everywhere and always which the people are not able to see.

But an even more serious condition results from the unnatural
alignment of the old parties. To-day we Americans are politically
shattered by sectionalism. Through the two old parties the tragedy of
our history is continued; and one great geographical part of the
Republic is separated from other parts of the Republic by an illogical
partisan solidarity.

The South has men and women as genuinely progressive and others

as genuinely reactionary as those in other parts of our country. Yet,
for well-known reasons, these sincere and honest southern
progressives and reactionaries vote together in a single party, which
is neither progressive nor reactionary. They vote a dead tradition and
a local fear, not a living conviction and a national faith. They vote
not for the Democratic party, but against the Republican party. They
want to be free from this condition; they can be free from it through
the National Progressive party.

For the problems which America faces to-day are economic and
national. They have to do with a more just distribution of prosperity.
They concern the living of the people; and therefore the more direct
government of the people by themselves.

They affect the South exactly as they affect the North, the East or the
West. It is an artificial and dangerous condition that prevents the
southern man and woman from acting with the northern man and
woman who believe the same thing. Yet just that is what the old
parties do prevent.

Not only does this out-of-date partisanship cut our Nation into two
geographical sections; it also robs the Nation of a priceless asset of
thought in working out our national destiny. The South once was
famous for brilliant and constructive thinking on national problems,
and to-day the South has minds as brilliant and constructive as of
old. But southern intellect cannot freely and fully aid, in terms of
politics, the solving of the Nation's problems. This is so because of a
partisan sectionalism which has nothing to do with those problems.
Yet these problems can be solved only in terms of politics.

The root of the wrongs which hurt the people is the fact that the
people's government has been taken away from them—the invisible
government has usurped the people's government. Their government
must be given back to the people. And so the first purpose of the
Progressive party is to make sure the rule of the people. The rule of
the people means that the people themselves shall nominate, as well
as elect, all candidates for office, including Senators and Presidents
of the United States. What profiteth it the people if they do only the
electing while the invisible government does the nominating?

The rule of the people means that when the people's legislators make
a law which hurts the people, the people themselves may reject it.
The rule of the people means that when the people's legislators
refuse to pass a law which the people need, the people themselves
may pass it. The rule of the people means that when the people's
employees do not do the people's work well and honestly, the people
may discharge them exactly as a business man discharges employees
who do not do their work well and honestly. The people's officials
are the people's servants, not the people's masters.

We progressives believe in this rule of the people that the people
themselves may deal with their own destiny. Who knows the
people's needs so well as the people themselves? Who so patient as
the people? Who so long suffering, who so just? Who so wise to
solve their own problems?

Today these problems concern the living of the people. Yet in the
present stage of American development these problems should not
exist in this country. For, in all the world there is no land so rich as
ours. Our fields can feed hundreds of millions. We have more
minerals than the whole of Europe. Invention has made easy the
turning of this vast natural wealth into supplies for all the needs of
man. One worker today can produce more than twenty workers
could produce a century ago.

The people living in this land of gold are the most daring and
resourceful on the globe. Coming from the hardiest stock of every
nation of the old world their very history in the new world has made
Americans a peculiar people in courage, initiative, love of justice
and all the elements of independent character.

And, compared with other peoples, we are very few in numbers.
There are only ninety millions of us, scattered over a continent.
Germany has sixty-five millions packed in a country very much
smaller than Texas. The population of Great Britain and Ireland
could be set down in California and still have more than enough
room for the population of Holland. If this country were as thickly
peopled as Belgium there would be more than twelve hundred
million instead of only ninety million persons within our borders.

So we have more than enough to supply every human being beneath
the flag. There ought not to be in this Republic a single day of bad
business, a single unemployed workingman, a single unfed child.
American business men should never know an hour of uncertainty,
discouragement or fear; American workingmen never a day of low
wages, idleness or want. Hunger should never walk in these thinly
peopled gardens of plenty.

And yet in spite of all these favors which providence has showered
upon us, the living of the people is the problem of the hour.
Hundreds of thousands of hard-working Americans find it difficult
to get enough to live on. The average income of an American laborer
is less than $[^5]:[^0]:[^0]: a year. With this he must furnish food, shelter and
clothing for a family.

Women, whose nourishing and protection should be the first care of
the State, not only are driven into the mighty army of wage-earners,
but are forced to work under unfair and degrading conditions. The
right of a child to grow into a normal human being is sacred; and
yet, while small and poor countries, packed with people, have
abolished child labor, American mills, mines, factories and sweat-
shops are destroying hundreds of thousands of American children in
body, mind and soul.

At the same time men have grasped fortunes in this country so great
that the human mind cannot comprehend their magnitude. These
mountains of wealth are far larger than even that lavish reward
which no one would deny to business risk or genius.

On the other hand, American business is uncertain and unsteady
compared with the business of other nations. American business
men are the best and bravest in the world, and yet our business
conditions hamper their energies and chill their courage. We have no
permanency in business affairs, no sure outlook upon the business
future. This unsettled state of American business prevents it from
realizing for the people that great and continuous prosperity which
our country's location, vast wealth and small population justifies.

We mean to remedy these conditions. We mean not only to make
prosperity steady, but to give to the many who earn it a just share of

that prosperity instead of helping the few who do not earn it to take
an unjust share. The progressive motto is "Pass prosperity around."
To make human living easier, to free the hands of honest business, to
make trade and commerce sound and steady, to protect womanhood,
save childhood and restore the dignity of manhood—these are the
tasks we must do.

What, then, is the progressive answer to these questions? We are
able to give it specifically and concretely. The first work before us is
the revival of honest business. For business is nothing but the
industrial and trade activities of all the people. Men grow the
products of the field, cut ripe timber from the forest, dig metal from
the mine, fashion all for human use, carry them to the market place
and exchange them according to their mutual needs—and this is
business.

With our vast advantages, contrasted with the vast disadvantages of
other nations, American business all the time should be the best and
steadiest in the world. But it is not. Germany, with shallow soil, no
mines, only a window on the seas and a population more than ten
times as dense as ours, yet has a sounder business, a steadier
prosperity, a more contented because better cared for people.

What, then, must we do to make American business better? We must
do what poorer nations have done. We must end the abuses of
business by striking down those abuses instead of striking down
business itself. We must try to make little business big and all
business honest instead of striving to make big business little and yet
letting it remain dishonest.

Present-day business is as unlike old-time business as the old-time
ox-cart is unlike the present-day locomotive. Invention has made the
whole world over again. The railroad, telegraph, telephone have
bound the people of modern nations into families. To do the business
of these closely knit millions in every modern country great business
concerns came into being. What we call big business is the child of
the economic progress of mankind. So warfare to destroy big
business is foolish because it can not succeed and wicked because it
ought not to succeed. Warfare to destroy big business does not hurt
big business, which always comes out on top, so much as it hurts all

other business which, in such a warfare, never comes out on top.

With the growth of big business came business evils just as great. It
is these evils of big business that hurt the people and injure all other
business. One of these wrongs is over capitalization which taxes the
people's very living. Another is the manipulation of prices to the
unsettlement of all normal business and to the people's damage.
Another is interference in the making of the people's laws and the
running of the people's government in the unjust interest of evil
business. Getting laws that enable particular interests to rob the
people, and even to gather criminal riches from human health and
life is still another.

An example of such laws is the infamous tobacco legislation of
[^1]:[^9]:[^0]:[^2]:, which authorized the Tobacco Trust to continue to collect
from the people the Spanish War tax, amounting to a score of
millions of dollars, but to keep that tax instead of turning it over to
the government, as it had been doing. Another example is the
shameful meat legislation, by which the Beef Trust had the meat it
sent abroad inspected by the government so that foreign countries
would take its product and yet was permitted to sell diseased meat to
our own people. It is incredible that laws like these could ever get on
the Nation's statute books. The invisible government put them there;
and only the universal wrath of an enraged people corrected them
when, after years, the people discovered the outrages.

It is to get just such laws as these and to prevent the passage of laws
to correct them, as well as to keep off the statute books general laws
which will end the general abuses of big business that these few
criminal interests corrupt our politics, invest in public officials and
keep in power in both parties that type of politicians and party
managers who debase American politics.

Behind rotten laws and preventing sound laws, stands the corrupt
boss; behind the corrupt boss stands the robber interest; and
commanding these powers of pillage stands bloated human greed. It
is this conspiracy of evil we must overthrow if we would get the
honest laws we need. It is this invisible government we must destroy
if we would save American institutions.

Other nations have ended the very same business evils from which
we suffer by clearly defining business wrong-doing and then making
it a criminal offense, punishable by imprisonment. Yet these foreign
nations encourage big business itself and foster all honest business.
But they do not tolerate dishonest business, little or big.

What, then, shall we Americans do? Common sense and the
experience of the world says that we ought to keep the good big
business does for us and stop the wrongs that big business does to
us. Yet we have done just the other thing. We have struck at big
business itself and have not even aimed to strike at the evils of big
business. Nearly twenty-five years ago Congress passed a law to
govern American business in the present time which Parliament
passed in the reign of King James to govern English business in that
time.

For a quarter of a century the courts have tried to make this law
work. Yet during this very time trusts grew greater in number and
power than in the whole history of the world before; and their evils
flourished unhindered and unchecked. These great business concerns
grew because natural laws made them grow and artificial law at war
with natural law could not stop their growth. But their evils grew
faster than the trusts themselves because avarice nourished those
evils and no law of any kind stopped avarice from nourishing them.

Nor is this the worst. Under the shifting interpretation of the
Sherman law, uncertainty and fear is chilling the energies of the
great body of honest American business men. As the Sherman law
now stands, no two business men can arrange their mutual affairs
and be sure that they are not law-breakers. This is the main
hindrance to the immediate and permanent revival of American
business. If German or English business men, with all their
disadvantages compared with our advantages, were manacled by our
Sherman law, as it stands, they soon would be bankrupt. Indeed,
foreign business men declare that, if their countries had such a law,
so administered, they could not do business at all.

Even this is not all. By the decrees of our courts, under the Sherman
law, the two mightiest trusts on earth have actually been licensed, in
the practical outcome, to go on doing every wrong they ever

committed. Under the decrees of the courts the Oil and Tobacco
Trusts still can raise prices unjustly and already have done so. They
still can issue watered stock and surely will do so. They still can
throttle other business men and the United Cigar Stores Company
now is doing so. They still can corrupt our politics and this moment
are indulging in that practice.

The people are tired of this mock battle with criminal capital. They
do not want to hurt business, but they do want to get something done
about the trust question that amounts to something. What good does
it do any man to read in his morning paper that the courts have
"dissolved" the Oil Trust, and then read in his evening paper that he
must thereafter pay a higher price for his oil than ever before? What
good does it do the laborer who smokes his pipe to be told that the
courts have "dissolved" the Tobacco Trust and yet find that he must
pay the same or a higher price for the same short-weight package of
tobacco? Yet all this is the practical result of the suits against these
two greatest trusts in the world.

Such business chaos and legal paradoxes as American business
suffers from can be found nowhere else in the world. Rival nations
do not fasten legal ball and chain upon their business—no, they put
wings on its flying feet. Rival nations do not tell their business men
that if they go forward with legitimate enterprise the penitentiary
may be their goal. No! Rival nations tell their business men that so
long as they do honest business their governments will not hinder
but will help them.

But these rival nations do tell their business men that if they do any
evil that our business men do, prison bars await them. These rival
nations do tell their business men that if they issue watered stock or
cheat the people in any way, prison cells will be their homes.

Just this is what all honest American business wants; just this is
what dishonest American business does not want; just this is what
the American people propose to have; just this the national
Republican platform of [^1]:[^9]:[^0]:[^8]: pledged the people that we would give
them; and just this important pledge the administration, elected on
that platform, repudiated as it repudiated the more immediate tariff
pledge.

Both these reforms, so vital to honest American business, the
Progressive party will accomplish. Neither evil interests nor reckless
demagogues can swerve us from our purpose; for we are free from
both and fear neither.

We mean to put new business laws on our statute books which will
tell American business men what they can do and what they cannot
do. We mean to make our business laws clear instead of foggy—to
make them plainly state just what things are criminal and what are
lawful. And we mean that the penalty for things criminal shall be
prison sentences that actually punish the real offender, instead of
money fines that hurt nobody but the people, who must pay them in
the end.

And then we mean to send the message forth to hundreds of
thousands of brilliant minds and brave hearts engaged in honest
business, that they are not criminals but honorable men in their work
to make good business in this Republic. Sure of victory, we even
now say, "Go forward, American business men, and know that
behind you, supporting you, encouraging you, are the power and
approval of the greatest people under the sun. Go forward, American
business men, and feed full the fires beneath American furnaces; and
give employment to every American laborer who asks for work. Go
forward, American business men, and capture the markets of the
world for American trade; and know that on the wings of your
commerce you carry liberty throughout the world and to every
inhabitant thereof. Go forward, American business men, and realize
that in the time to come it shall be said of you, as it is said of the
hand that rounded Peter's Dome, 'he builded better than he knew.'"

The next great business reform we must have to steadily increase
American prosperity is to change the method of building our tariffs.
The tariff must be taken out of politics and treated as a business
question instead of as a political question. Heretofore, we have done
just the other thing. That is why American business is upset every
few years by unnecessary tariff upheavals and is weakened by
uncertainty in the periods between. The greatest need of business is
certainty; but the only thing certain about our tariff is uncertainty.

What, then, shall we do to make our tariff changes strengthen

business instead of weakening business? Rival protective tariff
nations have answered that question. Common sense has answered
it. Next to our need to make the Sherman law modern,
understandable and just, our greatest fiscal need is a genuine,
permanent, non-partisan tariff commission.

Five years ago, when the fight for this great business measure was
begun in the Senate the bosses of both parties were against it. So,
when the last revision of the tariff was on and a tariff commission
might have been written into the tariff law, the administration would
not aid this reform. When two years later the administration
supported it weakly, the bi-partisan boss system killed it. There has
not been and will not be any sincere and honest effort by the old
parties to get a tariff commission. There has not been and will not be
any sincere and honest purpose by those parties to take the tariff out
of politics.

For the tariff in politics is the excuse for those sham political battles
which give the spoilers their opportunity. The tariff in politics is one
of the invisible government's methods of wringing tribute from the
people. Through the tariff in politics the beneficiaries of tariff
excesses are cared for, no matter which party is "revising."

Who has forgotten the tariff scandals that made President Cleveland
denounce the Wilson-Gorman bill as "a perfidy and a dishonor?"
Who ever can forget the brazen robberies forced into the Payne-
Aldrich bill which Mr. Taft defended as "the best ever made?" If
everyone else forgets these things the interests that profited by them
never will forget them. The bosses and lobbyists that grew rich by
putting them through never will forget them. That is why the
invisible government and its agents want to keep the old method of
tariff building. For, though such tariff "revisions" may make lean
years for the people, they make fat years for the powers of pillage
and their agents.

So neither of the old parties can honestly carry out any tariff policies
which they pledge the people to carry out. But even if they could
and even if they were sincere, the old party platforms are in error on
tariff policy. The Democratic platform declares for free trade; but
free trade is wrong and ruinous. The Republican platform permits

extortion; but tariff extortion is robbery by law. The Progressive
party is for honest protection; and honest protection is right and a
condition of American prosperity.

A tariff high enough to give American producers the American
market when they make honest goods and sell them at honest prices
but low enough that when they sell dishonest goods at dishonest
prices, foreign competition can correct both evils; a tariff high
enough to enable American producers to pay our workingmen
American wages and so arranged that the workingmen will get such
wages; a business tariff whose changes will be so made as to
reassure business instead of disturbing it—this is the tariff and the
method of its making in which the Progressive party believes, for
which it does battle and which it proposes to write into the laws of
the land.

The Payne-Aldrich tariff law must be revised immediately in
accordance to these principles. At the same time a genuine,
permanent, non-partisan tariff commission must be fixed in the law
as firmly as the Interstate Commerce Commission. Neither of the old
parties can do this work. For neither of the old parties believes in
such a tariff; and, what is more serious, special privilege is too
thoroughly woven into the fiber of both old parties to allow them to
make such a tariff. The Progressive party only is free from these
influences. The Progressive party only believes in the sincere
enactment of a sound tariff policy. The Progressive party only can
change the tariff as it must be changed.

These are samples of the reforms in the laws of business that we
intend to put on the Nation's statute books. But there are other
questions as important and pressing that we mean to answer by
sound and humane laws. Child labor in factories, mills, mines and
sweat-shops must be ended throughout the Republic. Such labor is a
crime against childhood because it prevents the growth of normal
manhood and womanhood. It is a crime against the Nation because it
prevents the growth of a host of children into strong, patriotic and
intelligent citizens.

Only the Nation can stop this industrial vice. The States cannot stop
it. The States never stopped any national wrong—and child labor is

a national wrong. To leave it to the State alone is unjust to business;
for if some States stop it and other States do not, business men of the
former are at a disadvantage with the business men of the latter,
because they must sell in the same market goods made by manhood
labor at manhood wages in competition with goods made by
childhood labor at childhood wages. To leave it to the States is
unjust to manhood labor; for childhood labor in any State lowers
manhood labor in every State, because the product of childhood
labor in any State competes with the product of manhood labor in
every State. Children workers at the looms in South Carolina means
bayonets at the breasts of men and women workers in Massachusetts
who strike for living wages. Let the States do what they can, and
more power to their arm; but let the Nation do what it should and
cleanse our flag from this stain.

Modern industrialism has changed the status of women. Women
now are wage earners in factories, stores and other places of toil. In
hours of labor and all the physical conditions of industrial effort they
must compete with men. And they must do it at lower wages than
men receive—wages which, in most cases, are not enough for these
women workers to live on.

This is inhuman and indecent. It is unsocial and uneconomic. It is
immoral and unpatriotic. Toward women the Progressive party
proclaims the chivalry of the State. We propose to protect women
wage-earners by suitable laws, an example of which is the minimum
wage for women workers—a wage which shall be high enough to at
least buy clothing, food and shelter for the woman toiler.

The care of the aged is one of the most perplexing problems of
modern life. How is the workingman with less than five hundred
dollars a year, and with earning power waning as his own years
advance, to provide for aged parents or other relatives in addition to
furnishing food, shelter and clothing for his wife and children? What
is to become of the family of the laboring man whose strength has
been sapped by excessive toil and who has been thrown upon the
industrial scrap heap? It is questions like these we must answer if we
are to justify free institutions. They are questions to which the
masses of people are chained as to a body of death. And they are
questions which other and poorer nations are answering.

We progressives mean that America shall answer them. The
Progressive party is the helping hand to those whom a vicious
industrialism has maimed and crippled. We are for the conservation
of our natural resources; but even more we are for the conservation
of human life. Our forests, water power and minerals are valuable
and must be saved from the spoilers; but men, women and children
are more valuable and they, too, must be saved from the spoilers.

Because women, as much as men, are a part of our economic and
social life, women, as much as men, should have the voting power to
solve all economic and social problems. Votes for women are theirs
as a matter of natural right alone; votes for women should be theirs
as a matter of political wisdom also. As wage-earners, they should
help to solve the labor problem; as property owners they should help
to solve the tax problem; as wives and mothers they should help to
solve all the problems that concern the home. And that means all
national problems; for the Nation abides at the fireside.

If it is said that women cannot help defend the Nation in time of war
and therefore that they should not help to determine the Nation's
destinies in time of peace, the answer is that women suffer and serve
in time of conflict as much as men who carry muskets. And the
deeper answer is that those who bear the Nation's soldiers are as
much the Nation's defenders as their sons.

Public spokesmen for the invisible government say that many of our
reforms are unconstitutional. The same kind of men said the same
thing of every effort the Nation has made to end national abuses. But
in every case, whether in the courts, at the ballot box, or on the
battlefield, the vitality of the Constitution was vindicated.

The Progressive party believes that the Constitution is a living thing,
growing with the people's growth, strengthening with the people's
strength, aiding the people in their struggle for life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness, permitting the people to meet all their needs as
conditions change. The opposition believes that the Constitution is a
dead form, holding back the people's growth, shackling the people's
strength but giving a free hand to malign powers that prey upon the
people. The first words of the Constitution are "We the people," and
they declare that the Constitution's purpose is "to form a perfect

Union and to promote the general welfare." To do just that is the
very heart of the progressive cause.

The Progressive party asserts anew the vitality of the Constitution.
We believe in the true doctrine of states' rights, which forbids the
Nation from interfering with states' affairs, and also forbids the
states from interfering with national affairs. The combined
intelligence and composite conscience of the American people is as
irresistible as it is righteous; and the Constitution does not prevent
that force from working out the general welfare.

From certain sources we hear preachments about the danger of our
reforms to American institutions. What is the purpose of American
institutions? Why was this Republic established? What does the flag
stand for? What do these things mean?

They mean that the people shall be free to correct human abuses.

They mean that men, women and children shall not be denied the
opportunity to grow stronger and nobler.

They mean that the people shall have the power to make our land
each day a better place to live in.

They mean the realities of liberty and not the academics of theory.

They mean the actual progress of the race in tangible items of daily
living and not the theoretics of barren disputation.

If they do not mean these things they are as sounding brass and
tinkling cymbals.

A Nation of strong, upright men and women; a Nation of wholesome
homes, realizing the best ideals; a Nation whose power is glorified
by its justice and whose justice is the conscience of scores of
millions of God-fearing people—that is the Nation the people need
and want. And that is the Nation they shall have.

For never doubt that we Americans will make good the real meaning
of our institutions. Never doubt that we will solve, in righteousness
and wisdom, every vexing problem. Never doubt that in the end, the
hand from above that leads us upward will prevail over the hand

from below that drags us downward. Never doubt that we are indeed
a Nation whose God is the Lord.

And, so, never doubt that a braver, fairer, cleaner America surely
will come; that a better and brighter life for all beneath the flag
surely will be achieved. Those who now scoff soon will pray. Those
who now doubt soon will believe.

Soon the night will pass; and when, to the Sentinel on the ramparts
of Liberty the anxious ask: "Watchman, what of the night?" his
answer will be "Lo, the morn appeareth."

Knowing the price we must pay, the sacrifice we must make, the
burdens we must carry, the assaults we must endure—knowing full
well the cost—yet we enlist, and we enlist for the war. For we know
the justice of our cause, and we know, too, its certain triumph.

Not reluctantly then, but eagerly, not with faint hearts but strong, do
we now advance upon the enemies of the people. For the call that
comes to us is the call that came to our fathers. As they responded so
shall we.

ACRES OF DIAMONDS[[^4][^0]]
```

I am astonished that so many people should care to hear this story
over again. Indeed, this lecture has become a study in psychology; it
often breaks all rules of oratory, departs from the precepts of
rhetoric, and yet remains the most popular of any lecture I have
delivered in the forty-four years of my public life. I have sometimes
studied for a year upon a lecture and made careful research, and then
presented the lecture just once—never delivered it again. I put too
much work on it. But this had no work on it—thrown together
perfectly at random, spoken offhand without any special preparation,
and it succeeds when the thing we study, work over, adjust to a plan,
is an entire failure.

The "Acres of Diamonds" which I have mentioned through so many
years are to be found in Philadelphia, and you are to find them.
Many have found them. And what man has done, man can do. I
could not find anything better to illustrate my thought than a story I
have told over and over again, and which is now found in books in
nearly every library.

In [^1]:[^8]:[^7]:[^0]: we went down the Tigris River. We hired a guide at Bagdad
to show us Persepolis, Nineveh and Babylon, and the ancient
countries of Assyria as far as the Arabian Gulf. He was well
acquainted with the land, but he was one of those guides who love to
entertain their patrons; he was like a barber that tells you many
stories in order to keep your mind off the scratching and the
scraping. He told me so many stories that I grew tired of his telling

them and I refused to listen—looked away whenever he
commenced; that made the guide quite angry. I remember that
toward evening he took his Turkish cap off his head and swung it
around in the air. The gesture I did not understand and I did not dare
look at him for fear I should become the victim of another story. But,
although I am not a woman, I did look, and the instant I turned my
eyes upon that worthy guide he was off again. Said he, "I will tell
you a story now which reserve for my particular friends!" So then,
counting myself a particular friend, I listened, and I have always
been glad I did.

He said there once lived not far from the River Indus an ancient
Persian by the name of Al Hafed. He said that Al Hafed owned a
very large farm with orchards, grain fields and gardens. He was a
contented and wealthy man—contented because he was wealthy, and
wealthy because he was contented. One day there visited this old
farmer one of those ancient Buddhist priests, and he sat down by Al
Hafed's fire and told that old farmer how this world of ours was
made. He said that this world was once a mere bank of fog, which is
scientifically true, and he said that the Almighty thrust his finger
into the bank of fog and then began slowly to move his finger
around and gradually to increase the speed of his finger until at last
he whirled that bank of fog into a solid ball of fire, and it went
rolling through the universe, burning its way through other cosmic
banks of fog, until it condensed the moisture without, and fell in
floods of rain upon the heated surface and cooled the outward crust.
Then the internal flames burst through the cooling crust and threw
up the mountains and made the hills of the valley of this wonderful
world of ours. If this internal melted mass burst out and copied very
quickly it became granite; that which cooled less quickly became
silver; and less quickly, gold; and after gold diamonds were made.
Said the old priest, "A diamond is a congealed drop of sunlight."

This is a scientific truth also. You all know that a diamond is pure
carbon, actually deposited sunlight—and he said another thing I
would not forget: he declared that a diamond is the last and highest
of God's mineral creations, as a woman is the last and highest of
God's animal creations. I suppose that is the reason why the two
have such a liking for each other. And the old priest told Al Hafed

that if he had a handful of diamonds he could purchase a whole
country, and with a mine of diamonds he could place his children
upon thrones through the influence of their great wealth. Al Hafed
heard all about diamonds and how much they were worth, and went
to his bed that night a poor man—not that he had lost anything, but
poor because he was discontented and discontented because he
thought he was poor. He said: "I want a mine of diamonds!" So he
lay awake all night, and early in the morning sought out the priest.
Now I know from experience that a priest when awakened early in
the morning is cross. He awoke that priest out of his dreams and said
to him, "Will you tell me where I can find diamonds?" The priest
said, "Diamonds? What do you want with diamonds?" "I want to be
immensely rich," said Al Hafed, "but I don't know where to go."
"Well," said the priest, "if you will find a river that runs over white
sand between high mountains, in those sands you will always see
diamonds." "Do you really believe that there is such a river?"
"Plenty of them, plenty of them; all you have to do is just go and
find them, then you have them." Al Hafed said, "I will go." So he
sold his farm, collected his money at interest, left his family in
charge of a neighbor, and away he went in search of diamonds. He
began very properly, to my mind, at the Mountains of the Moon.
Afterwards he went around into Palestine, then wandered on into
Europe, and at last when his money was all spent, and he was in
rags, wretchedness and poverty, he stood on the shore of that bay in
Barcelona, Spain, when a tidal wave came rolling through the Pillars
of Hercules and the poor afflicted, suffering man could not resist the
awful temptation to cast himself into that incoming tide, and he sank
beneath its foaming crest, never to rise in this life again.

When that old guide had told me that very sad story, he stopped the
camel I was riding and went back to fix the baggage on one of the
other camels, and I remember thinking to myself, "Why did he
reserve that for his _particular friends_?" There seemed to be no
beginning, middle or end—nothing to it. That was the first story I
ever heard told or read in which the hero was killed in the first
chapter. I had but one chapter of that story and the hero was dead.
When the guide came back and took up the halter of my camel
again, he went right on with the same story. He said that Al Hafed's
successor led his camel out into the garden to drink, and as that

camel put its nose down into the clear water of the garden brook Al
Hafed's successor noticed a curious flash of light from the sands of
the shallow stream, and reaching in he pulled out a black stone
having an eye of light that reflected all the colors of the rainbow, and
he took that curious pebble into the house and left it on the mantel,
then went on his way and forgot all about it. A few days after that,
this same old priest who told Al Hafed how diamonds were made,
came in to visit his successor, when he saw that flash of light from
the mantel. He rushed up and said, "Here is a diamond—here is a
diamond! Has Al Hafed returned?" "No, no; Al Hafed has not
returned and that is not a diamond; that is nothing but a stone; we
found it right out here in our garden." "But I know a diamond when I
see it," said he; "that is a diamond!"

Then together they rushed to the garden and stirred up the white
sands with their fingers and found others more beautiful, more
valuable diamonds than the first, and thus, said the guide to me,
were discovered the diamond mines of Golconda, the most
magnificent diamond mines in all the history of mankind, exceeding
the Kimberley in its value. The great Kohinoor diamond in
England's crown jewels and the largest crown diamond on earth in
Russia's crown jewels, which I had often hoped she would have to
sell before they had peace with Japan, came from that mine, and
when the old guide had called my attention to that wonderful
discovery he took his Turkish cap off his head again and swung it
around in the air to call my attention to the moral. Those Arab
guides have a moral to each story, though the stories are not always
moral. He said, had Al Hafed remained at home and dug in his own
cellar or in his own garden, instead of wretchedness, starvation,
poverty and death in a strange land, he would have had "acres of
diamonds"—for every acre, yes, every shovelful of that old farm
afterwards revealed the gems which since have decorated the crowns
of monarchs. When he had given the moral to his story, I saw why
he had reserved this story for his "particular friends." I didn't tell him
I could see it; I was not going to tell that old Arab that I could see it.
For it was that mean old Arab's way of going around a thing, like a
lawyer, and saying indirectly what he did not dare say directly, that
there was a certain young man that day traveling down the Tigris
River that might better be at home in America. I didn't tell him I

could see it.

I told him his story reminded me of one, and I told it to him quick. I
told him about that man out in California, who, in [^1]:[^8]:[^4]:[^7]:, owned a
ranch out there. He read that gold had been discovered in Southern
California, and he sold his ranch to Colonel Sutter and started off to
hunt for gold. Colonel Sutter put a mill on the little stream in that
farm and one day his little girl brought some wet sand from the
raceway of the mill into the house and placed it before the fire to
dry, and as that sand was falling through the little girl's fingers a
visitor saw the first shining scales of real gold that were ever
discovered in California; and the man who wanted the gold had sold
this ranch and gone away, never to return. I delivered this lecture
two years ago in California, in the city that stands near that farm,
and they told me that the mine is not exhausted yet, and that a one-
third owner of that farm has been getting during these recent years
twenty dollars of gold every fifteen minutes of his life, sleeping or
waking. Why, you and I would enjoy an income like that!

But the best illustration that I have now of this thought was found
here in Pennsylvania. There was a man living in Pennsylvania who
owned a farm here and he did what I should do if I had a farm in
Pennsylvania—he sold it. But before he sold it he concluded to
secure employment collecting coal oil for his cousin in Canada.
They first discovered coal oil there. So this farmer in Pennsylvania
decided that he would apply for a position with his cousin in
Canada. Now, you see, this farmer was not altogether a foolish man.
He did not leave his farm until he had something else to do. Of all
the simpletons the stars shine on there is none more foolish than a
man who leaves one job before he has obtained another. And that
has especial reference to gentlemen of my profession, and has no
reference to a man seeking a divorce. So I say this old farmer did not
leave one job until he had obtained another. He wrote to Canada, but
his cousin replied that he could not engage him because he did not
know anything about the oil business. "Well, then," said he, "I will
understand it." So he set himself at the study of the whole subject.
He began at the second day of the creation, he studied the subject
from the primitive vegetation to the coal oil stage, until he knew all
about it. Then he wrote to his cousin and said, "Now I understand

the oil business." And his cousin replied to him, "All right, then,
come on."

That man, by the record of the county, sold his farm for eight
hundred and thirty-three dollars—even money, "no cents." He had
scarcely gone from that farm before the man who purchased it went
out to arrange for the watering the cattle and he found that the
previous owner had arranged the matter very nicely. There is a
stream running down the hillside there, and the previous owner had
gone out and put a plank across that stream at an angle, extending
across the brook and down edgewise a few inches under the surface
of the water. The purpose of the plank across that brook was to
throw over to the other bank a dreadful-looking scum through which
the cattle would not put their noses to drink above the plank,
although they would drink the water on one side below it. Thus that
man who had gone to Canada had been himself damming back for
twenty-three years a flow of coal oil which the State Geologist of
Pennsylvania declared officially, as early as [^1]:[^8]:[^7]:[^0]:, was then worth to
our State a hundred millions of dollars. The city of Titusville now
stands on that farm and those Pleasantville wells flow on, and that
farmer who had studied all about the formation of oil since the
second day of God's creation clear down to the present time, sold
that farm for $[^8]:[^3]:[^3]:, no cents—again I say, "no sense."

But I need another illustration, and I found that in Massachusetts,
and I am sorry I did, because that is my old State. This young man I
mention went out of the State to study—went down to Yale College
and studied Mines and Mining. They paid him fifteen dollars a week
during his last year for training students who were behind their
classes in mineralogy, out of hours, of course, while pursuing his
own studies. But when he graduated they raised his pay from fifteen
dollars to forty-five dollars and offered him a professorship. Then he
went straight home to his mother and said, "Mother, I won't work for
forty-five dollars a week. What is forty-five dollars a week for a man
with a brain like mine! Mother, let's go out to California and stake
out gold claims and be immensely rich." "Now," said his mother, "it
is just as well to be happy as it is to be rich."

But as he was the only son he had his way—they always do; and
they sold out in Massachusetts and went to Wisconsin, where he

went into the employ of the Superior Copper Mining Company, and
he was lost from sight in the employ of that company at fifteen
dollars a week again. He was also to have an interest in any mines
that he should discover for that company. But I do not believe that
he has ever discovered a mine—I do not know anything about it, but
I do not believe he has. I know he had scarcely gone from the old
homestead before the farmer who had bought the homestead went
out to dig potatoes, and as he was bringing them in in a large basket
through the front gateway, the ends of the stone wall came so near
together at the gate that the basket hugged very tight. So he set the
basket on the ground and pulled, first on one side and then on the
other side. Our farms in Massachusetts are mostly stone walls, and
the farmers have to be economical with their gateways in order to
have some place to put the stones. That basket hugged so tight there
that as he was hauling it through he noticed in the upper stone next
the gate a block of native silver, eight inches square; and this
professor of mines and mining and mineralogy, who would not work
for forty-five dollars a week, when he sold that homestead in
Massachusetts, sat right on that stone to make the bargain. He was
brought up there; he had gone back and forth by that piece of silver,
rubbed it with his sleeve, and it seemed to say, "Come now, now,
now, here is a hundred thousand dollars. Why not take me?" But he
would not take it. There was no silver in Newburyport; it was all
away off—well, I don't know where; he didn't, but somewhere else
—and he was a professor of mineralogy.

I do not know of anything I would enjoy better than to take the
whole time to-night telling of blunders like that I have heard
professors make. Yet I wish I knew what that man is doing out there
in Wisconsin. I can imagine him out there, as he sits by his fireside,
and he is saying to his friends, "Do you know that man Conwell that
lives in Philadelphia?" "Oh, yes, I have heard of him." "And do you
know that man Jones that lives in that city?" "Yes, I have heard of
him." And then he begins to laugh and laugh and says to his friends,
"They have done the same thing I did, precisely." And that spoils the
whole joke, because you and I have done it.

Ninety out of every hundred people here have made that mistake this
very day. I say you ought to be rich; you have no right to be poor. To

live in Philadelphia and not be rich is a misfortune, and it is doubly a
misfortune, because you could have been rich just as well as be poor.
Philadelphia furnishes so many opportunities. You ought to be rich.
But persons with certain religious prejudice will ask, "How can you
spend your time advising the rising generation to give their time to
getting money—dollars and cents—the commercial spirit?"

Yet I must say that you ought to spend time getting rich. You and I
know there are some things more valuable than money; of course,
we do. Ah, yes! By a heart made unspeakably sad by a grave on
which the autumn leaves now fall, I know there are some things
higher and grander and sublimer than money. Well does the man
know, who has suffered, that there are some things sweeter and
holier and more sacred than gold. Nevertheless, the man of common
sense also knows that there is not any one of those things that is not
greatly enhanced by the use of money. Money is power. Love is the
grandest thing on God's earth, but fortunate the lover who has plenty
of money. Money is power; money has powers; and for a man to say,
"I do not want money," is to say, "I do not wish to do any good to
my fellowmen." It is absurd thus to talk. It is absurd to disconnect
them. This is a wonderfully great life, and you ought to spend your
time getting money, because of the power there is in money. And yet
this religious prejudice is so great that some people think it is a great
honor to be one of God's poor. I am looking in the faces of people
who think just that way. I heard a man once say in a prayer meeting
that he was thankful that he was one of God's poor, and then I
silently wondered what his wife would say to that speech, as she
took in washing to support the man while he sat and smoked on the
veranda. I don't want to see any more of that land of God's poor.
Now, when a man could have been rich just as well, and he is now
weak because he is poor, he has done some great wrong; he has been
untruthful to himself; he has been unkind to his fellowmen. We
ought to get rich if we can by honorable and Christian methods, and
these are the only methods that sweep us quickly toward the goal of
riches.

I remember, not many years ago a young theological student who
came into my office and said to me that he thought it was his duty to
come in and "labor with me." I asked him what had happened, and

he said: "I feel it is my duty to come in and speak to you, sir, and say
that the Holy Scriptures declare that money is the root of all evil." I
asked him where he found that saying, and he said he found it in the
Bible. I asked him whether he had made a new Bible, and he said,
no, he had not gotten a new Bible, that it was in the old Bible.
"Well," I said, "if it is in my Bible, I never saw it. Will you please
get the text-book and let me see it?" He left the room and soon came
stalking in with his Bible open, with all the bigoted pride of the
narrow sectarian, who founds his creed on some misinterpretation of
Scripture, and he put the Bible down on the table before me and
fairly squealed into my ear, "There it is. You can read it for
yourself." I said to him, "Young man, you will learn, when you get a
little older, that you cannot trust another denomination to read the
Bible for you." I said, "Now, you belong to another denomination.
Please read it to me, and remember that you are taught in a school
where emphasis is exegesis." So he took the Bible and read it: "The
_love_ of money is the root of all evil." Then he had it right. The Great
Book has come back into the esteem and love of the people, and into
the respect of the greatest minds of earth, and now you can quote it
and rest your life and your death on it without more fear. So, when
he quoted right from the Scriptures he quoted the truth. "The love of
money is the root of all evil." Oh, that is it. It is the worship of the
means instead of the end, though you cannot reach the end without
the means. When a man makes an idol of the money instead of the
purposes for which it may be used, when he squeezes the dollar until
the eagle squeals, then it is made the root of all evil. Think, if you
only had the money, what you could do for your wife, your child,
and for your home and your city. Think how soon you could endow
the Temple College yonder if you only had the money and the
disposition to give it; and yet, my friend, people say you and I
should not spend the time getting rich. How inconsistent the whole
thing is. We ought to be rich, because money has power. I think the
best thing for me to do is to illustrate this, for if I say you ought to
get rich, I ought, at least, to suggest how it is done. We get a
prejudice against rich men because of the lies that are told about
them. The lies that are told about Mr. Rockefeller because he has
two hundred million dollars—so many believe them; yet how false
is the representation of that man to the world. How little we can tell
what is true nowadays when newspapers try to sell their papers

entirely on some sensation! The way they lie about the rich men is
something terrible, and I do not know that there is anything to
illustrate this better than what the newspapers now say about the city
of Philadelphia. A young man came to me the other day and said, "If
Mr. Rockefeller, as you think, is a good man, why is it that
everybody says so much against him?" It is because he has gotten
ahead of us; that is the whole of it—just gotten ahead of us. Why is
it Mr. Carnegie is criticised so sharply by an envious world?
Because he has gotten more than we have. If a man knows more
than I know, don't I incline to criticise somewhat his learning? Let a
man stand in a pulpit and preach to thousands, and if I have fifteen
people in my church, and they're all asleep, don't I criticise him? We
always do that to the man who gets ahead of us. Why, the man you
are criticising has one hundred millions, and you have fifty cents,
and both of you have just what you are worth. One of the richest
men in this country came into my home and sat down in my parlor
and said: "Did you see all those lies about my family in the paper?"
"Certainly I did; I knew they were lies when I saw them." "Why do
they lie about me the way they do?" "Well," I said to him, "if you
will give me your check for one hundred millions, I will take all the
lies along with it." "Well," said he, "I don't see any sense in their
thus talking about my family and myself. Conwell, tell me frankly,
what do you think the American people think of me?" "Well," said I,
"they think you are the blackest-hearted villain that ever trod the
soil!" "But what can I do about it?" There is nothing he can do about
it, and yet he is one of the sweetest Christian men I ever knew. If
you get a hundred millions you will have the lies; you will be lied
about, and you can judge your success in any line by the lies that are
told about you. I say that you ought to be rich. But there are ever
coming to me young men who say, "I would like to go into business,
but I cannot." "Why not?" "Because I have no capital to begin on."
Capital, capital to begin on! What! young man! Living in
Philadelphia and looking at this wealthy generation, all of whom
began as poor boys, and you want capital to begin on? It is fortunate
for you that you have no capital. I am glad you have no money. I
pity a rich man's son. A rich man's son in these days of ours occupies
a very difficult position. They are to be pitied. A rich man's son
cannot know the very best things in human life. He cannot. The
statistics of Massachusetts show us that not one out of seventeen rich

men's sons ever die rich. They are raised in luxury, they die in
poverty. Even if a rich man's son retains his father's money even
then he cannot know the best things of life.

A young man in our college yonder asked me to formulate for him
what I thought was the happiest hour in a man's history, and I
studied it long and came back convinced that the happiest hour that
any man ever sees in any earthly matter is when a young man takes
his bride over the threshold of the door, for the first time, of the
house he himself has earned and built, when he turns to his bride and
with an eloquence greater than any language of mine, he sayeth to
his wife, "My loved one, I earned this home myself; I earned it all. It
is all mine, and I divide it with thee." That is the grandest moment a
human heart may ever see. But a rich man's son cannot know that.
He goes into a finer mansion, it may be, but he is obliged to go
through the house and say, "Mother gave me this, mother gave me
that, my mother gave me that, my mother gave me that," until his
wife wishes she had married his mother. Oh, I pity a rich man's son.
I do. Until he gets so far along in his dudeism that he gets his arms
up like that and can't get them down. Didn't you ever see any of
them astray at Atlantic City? I saw one of these scarecrows once and
I never tire thinking about it. I was at Niagara Falls lecturing, and
after the lecture I went to the hotel, and when I went up to the desk
there stood there a millionaire's son from New York. He was an
indescribable specimen of anthropologic potency. He carried a gold-
headed cane under his arm—more in its head than he had in his. I do
not believe I could describe the young man if I should try. But still I
must say that he wore an eye-glass he could not see through; patent
leather shoes he could not walk in, and pants he could not sit down
in—dressed like a grasshopper! Well, this human cricket came up to
the clerk's desk just as I came in. He adjusted his unseeing eye-glass
in this wise and lisped to the clerk, because it's "Hinglish, you
know," to lisp: "Thir, thir, will you have the kindness to fuhnish me
with thome papah and thome envelopehs!" The clerk measured that
man quick, and he pulled out a drawer and took some envelopes and
paper and cast them across the counter and turned away to his books.
You should have seen that specimen of humanity when the paper
and envelopes came across the counter—he whose wants had always
been anticipated by servants. He adjusted his unseeing eye-glass and

he yelled after that clerk: "Come back here, thir, come right back
here. Now, thir, will you order a thervant to take that papah and
thothe envelopes and carry them to yondah dethk." Oh, the poor
miserable, contemptible American monkey! He couldn't carry paper
and envelopes twenty feet. I suppose he could not get his arms
down. I have no pity for such travesties of human nature. If you have
no capital, I am glad of it. You don't need capital; you need common
sense, not copper cents.

A.T. Stewart, the great princely merchant of New York, the richest
man in America in his time, was a poor boy; he had a dollar and a
half and went into the mercantile business. But he lost eighty-seven
and a half cents of his first dollar and a half because he bought some
needles and thread and buttons to sell, which people didn't want.

Are you poor? It is because you are not wanted and are left on your
own hands. There was the great lesson. Apply it whichever way you
will it comes to every single person's life, young or old. He did not
know what people needed, and consequently bought something they
didn't want and had the goods left on his hands a dead loss. A.T.
Stewart learned there the great lesson of his mercantile life and said,
"I will never buy anything more until I first learn what the people
want; then I'll make the purchase." He went around to the doors and
asked them what they did want, and when he found out what they
wanted, he invested his sixty-two and a half cents and began to
supply "a known demand." I care not what your profession or
occupation in life may be; I care not whether you are a lawyer, a
doctor, a housekeeper, teacher or whatever else, the principle is
precisely the same. We must know what the world needs first and
then invest ourselves to supply that need, and success is almost
certain. A.T. Stewart went on until he was worth forty millions.
"Well," you will say, "a man can do that in New York, but cannot do
it here in Philadelphia." The statistics very carefully gathered in
New York in [^1]:[^8]:[^8]:[^9]: showed one hundred and seven millionaires in
the city worth over ten millions apiece. It was remarkable and
people think they must go there to get rich. Out of that one hundred
and seven millionaires only seven of them made their money in New
York, and the others moved to New York after their fortunes were
made, and sixty-seven out of the remaining hundred made their

fortunes in towns of less than six thousand people, and the richest
man in the country at that time lived in a town of thirty-five hundred
inhabitants, and always lived there and never moved away. It is not
so much where you are as what you are. But at the same time if the
largeness of the city comes into the problem, then remember it is the
smaller city that furnishes the great opportunity to make the millions
of money. The best illustration that I can give is in reference to John
Jacob Astor, who was a poor boy and who made all the money of the
Astor family. He made more than his successors have ever earned,
and yet he once held a mortgage on a millinery store in New York,
and because the people could not make enough money to pay the
interest and the rent, he foreclosed the mortgage and took possession
of the store and went into partnership with the man who had failed.
He kept the same stock, did not give them a dollar capital, and he
left them alone and went out and sat down upon a bench in the park.
Out there on that bench in the park he had the most important, and to
my mind, the pleasantest part of that partnership business. He was
watching the ladies as they went by; and where is the man that
wouldn't get rich at that business? But when John Jacob Astor saw a
lady pass, with her shoulders back and her head up, as if she did not
care if the whole world looked on her, he studied her bonnet; and
before that bonnet was out of sight he knew the shape of the frame
and the color of the trimmings, the curl of the—something on a
bonnet. Sometimes I try to describe a woman's bonnet, but it is of
little use, for it would be out of style to-morrow night. So John Jacob
Astor went to the store and said: "Now, put in the show window just
such a bonnet as I describe to you because," said he, "I have just
seen a lady who likes just such a bonnet. Do not make up any more
till I come back." And he went out again and sat on that bench in the
park, and another lady of a different form and complexion passed
him with a bonnet of different shape and color, of course. "Now,"
said he, "put such a bonnet as that in the show window." He didn't
fill his show window with hats and bonnets which drive people away
and then sit in the back of the store and bawl because the people go
somewhere else to trade. He didn't put a hat or bonnet in that show
window the like of which he had not seen before it was made up.

In our city especially there are great opportunities for
manufacturing, and the time has come when the line is drawn very

sharply between the stockholders of the factory and their employés.
Now, friends, there has also come a discouraging gloom upon this
country and the laboring men are beginning to feel that they are
being held down by a crust over their heads through which they find
it impossible to break, and the aristocratic money-owner himself is
so far above that he will never descend to their assistance. That is
the thought that is in the minds of our people. But, friends, never in
the history of our country was there an opportunity so great for the
poor man to get rich as there is now in the city of Philadelphia. The
very fact that they get discouraged is what prevents them from
getting rich. That is all there is to it. The road is open, and let us
keep it open between the poor and the rich. I know that the labor
unions have two great problems to contend with, and there is only
one way to solve them. The labor unions are doing as much to
prevent its solving as are the capitalists to-day, and there are
positively two sides to it. The labor union has two difficulties; the
first one is that it began to make a labor scale for all classes on a par,
and they scale down a man that can earn five dollars a day to two
and a half a day, in order to level up to him an imbecile that cannot
earn fifty cents a day. That is one of the most dangerous and
discouraging things for the working man. He cannot get the results
of his work if he do better work or higher work or work longer; that
is a dangerous thing, and in order to get every laboring man free and
every American equal to every other American, let the laboring man
ask what he is worth and get it—not let any capitalist say to him:
"You shall work for me for half of what you are worth;" nor let any
labor organization say: "You shall work for the capitalist for half
your worth." Be a man, be independent, and then shall the laboring
man find the road ever open from poverty to wealth. The other
difficulty that the labor union has to consider, and this problem they
have to solve themselves, is the kind of orators who come and talk to
them about the oppressive rich. I can in my dreams recite the oration
I have heard again and again under such circumstances. My life has
been with the laboring man. I am a laboring man myself. I have
often, in their assemblies, heard the speech of the man who has been
invited to address the labor union. The man gets up before the
assembled company of honest laboring men and he begins by
saying: "Oh, ye honest, industrious laboring men, who have
furnished all the capital of the world, who have built all the palaces

and constructed all the railroads and covered the ocean with her
steamships. Oh, you laboring men! You are nothing but slaves; you
are ground down in the dust by the capitalist who is gloating over
you as he enjoys his beautiful estates and as he has his banks filled
with gold, and every dollar he owns is coined out of the hearts' blood
of the honest laboring man." Now, that is a lie, and you know it is a
lie; and yet that is the kind of speech that they are all the time
hearing, representing the capitalists as wicked and the laboring men
so enslaved. Why, how wrong it is! Let the man who loves his flag
and believes in American principles endeavor with all his soul to
bring the capitalist and the laboring man together until they stand
side by side, and arm in arm, and work for the common good of
humanity.

He is an enemy to his country who sets capital against labor or labor
against capital.

Suppose I were to go down through this audience and ask you to
introduce me to the great inventors who live here in Philadelphia.
"The inventors of Philadelphia," you would say, "Why we don't have
any in Philadelphia. It is too slow to invent anything." But you do
have just as great inventors, and they are here in this audience, as
ever invented a machine. But the probability is that the greatest
inventor to benefit the world with his discovery is some person,
perhaps some lady, who thinks she could not invent anything. Did
you ever study the history of invention and see how strange it was
that the man who made the greatest discovery did it without any
previous idea that he was an inventor? Who are the great inventors?
They are persons with plain, straightforward common sense, who
saw a need in the world and immediately applied themselves to
supply that need. If you want to invent anything, don't try to find it
in the wheels in your head nor the wheels in your machine, but first
find out what the people need, and then apply yourself to that need,
and this leads to invention on the part of the people you would not
dream of before. The great inventors are simply great men; the
greater the man the more simple the man; and the more simple a
machine, the more valuable it is. Did you ever know a really great
man? His ways are so simple, so common, so plain, that you think
any one could do what he is doing. So it is with the great men the

world over. If you know a really great man, a neighbor of yours, you
can go right up to him and say, "How are you, Jim, good morning,
Sam." Of course you can, for they are always so simple.

When I wrote the life of General Garfield, one of his neighbors took
me to his back door, and shouted, "Jim, Jim, Jim!" and very soon
"Jim" came to the door and General Garfield let me in—one of the
grandest men of our century. The great men of the world are ever so.
I was down in Virginia and went up to an educational institution and
was directed to a man who was setting out a tree. I approached him
and said, "Do you think it would be possible for me to see General
Robert E. Lee, the President of the University?" He said, "Sir, I am
General Lee." Of course, when you meet such a man, so noble a man
as that, you will find him a simple, plain man. Greatness is always
just so modest and great inventions are simple.

I asked a class in school once who were the great inventors, and a
little girl popped up and said, "Columbus." Well, now, she was not
so far wrong. Columbus bought a farm and he carried on that farm
just as I carried on my father's farm. He took a hoe and went out and
sat down on a rock. But Columbus, as he sat upon that shore and
looked out upon the ocean, noticed that the ships, as they sailed
away, sank deeper into the sea the farther they went. And since that
time some other "Spanish ships" have sunk into the sea. But as
Columbus noticed that the tops of the masts dropped down out of
sight, he said: "That is the way it is with this hoe handle; if you go
around this hoe handle, the farther off you go the farther down you
go. I can sail around to the East Indies." How plain it all was. How
simple the mind—majestic like the simplicity of a mountain in its
greatness. Who are the great inventors? They are ever the simple,
plain, everyday people who see the need and set about to supply it.

I was once lecturing in North Carolina, and the cashier of the bank
sat directly behind a lady who wore a very large hat. I said to that
audience, "Your wealth is too near to you; you are looking right over
it." He whispered to his friend, "Well, then, my wealth is in that hat."
A little later, as he wrote me, I said, "Wherever there is a human
need there is a greater fortune than a mine can furnish." He caught
my thought, and he drew up his plan for a better hat pin than was in
the hat before him, and the pin is now being manufactured. He was

offered fifty-five thousand dollars for his patent. That man made his
fortune before he got out of that hall. This is the whole question: Do
you see a need?

I remember well a man up in my native hills, a poor man, who for
twenty years was helped by the town in his poverty, who owned a
wide-spreading maple tree that covered the poor man's cottage like a
benediction from on high. I remember that tree, for in the spring—
there were some roguish boys around that neighborhood when I was
young—in the spring of the year the man would put a bucket there
and the spouts to catch the maple sap, and I remember where that
bucket was; and when I was young the boys were, oh, so mean, that
they went to that tree before that man had gotten out of bed in the
morning, and after he had gone to bed at night, and drank up that
sweet sap. I could swear they did it. He didn't make a great deal of
maple sugar from that tree. But one day he made the sugar so white
and crystalline that the visitor did not believe it was maple sugar;
thought maple sugar must be red or black. He said to the old man:
"Why don't you make it that way and sell it for confectionery?" The
old man caught his thought and invented the "rock maple crystal,"
and before that patent expired he had ninety thousand dollars and
had built a beautiful palace on the site of that tree. After forty years
owning that tree he awoke to find it had fortunes of money indeed in
it. And many of us are right by the tree that has a fortune for us, and
we own it, possess it, do what we will with it, but we do not learn its
value because we do not see the human need, and in these
discoveries and inventions this is one of the most romantic things of
life.

I have received letters from all over the country and from England,
where I have lectured, saying that they have discovered this and that,
and one man out in Ohio took me through his great factories last
spring, and said that they cost him $[^6]:[^8]:[^0]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:, and said he, "I was not
worth a cent in the world when I heard your lecture 'Acres of
Diamonds;' but I made up my mind to stop right here and make my
fortune here, and here it is." He showed me through his
unmortgaged possessions. And this is a continual experience now as
I travel through the country, after these many years. I mention this
incident, not to boast, but to show you that you can do the same if

you will.

Who are the great inventors? I remember a good illustration in a
man who used to live in East Brookfield, Mass. He was a
shoemaker, and he was out of work, and he sat around the house
until his wife told him to "go out doors." And he did what every
husband is compelled by law to do—he obeyed his wife. And he
went out and sat down on an ash barrel in his back yard. Think of it!
Stranded on an ash barrel and the enemy in possession of the house!
As he sat on that ash barrel, he looked down into that little brook
which ran through that back yard into the meadows, and he saw a
little trout go flashing up the stream and hiding under the bank. I do
not suppose he thought of Tennyson's beautiful poem:

```
"Chatter, chatter, as I flow,
To join the brimming river,
Men may come, and men may go,
But I go on forever."
```

But as this man looked into the brook, he leaped off that ash barrel
and managed to catch the trout with his fingers, and sent it to
Worcester. They wrote back that they would give him a five dollar
bill for another such trout as that, not that it was worth that much,
but they wished to help the poor man. So this shoemaker and his
wife, now perfectly united, that five dollar bill in prospect, went out
to get another trout. They went up the stream to its source and down
to the brimming river, but not another trout could they find in the
whole stream; and so they came home disconsolate and went to the
minister. The minister didn't know how trout grew, but he pointed
the way. Said he, "Get Seth Green's book, and that will give you the
information you want." They did so, and found all about the culture
of trout. They found that a trout lays thirty-six hundred eggs every
year and every trout gains a quarter of a pound every year, so that in
four years a little trout will furnish four tons per annum to sell to the
market at fifty cents a pound. When they found that, they said they
didn't believe any such story as that, but if they could get five dollars
apiece they could make something. And right in that same back yard
with the coal sifter up stream and window screen down the stream,
they began the culture of trout. They afterwards moved to the

Hudson, and since then he has become the authority in the United
States upon the raising of fish, and he has been next to the highest on
the United States Fish Commission in Washington. My lesson is that
man's wealth was out there in his back yard for twenty years, but he
didn't see it until his wife drove him out with a mop stick.

I remember meeting personally a poor carpenter of Hingham,
Massachusetts, who was out of work and in poverty. His wife also
drove him out of doors. He sat down on the shore and whittled a
soaked shingle into a wooden chain. His children quarreled over it in
the evening, and while he was whittling a second one, a neighbor
came along and said, "Why don't you whittle toys if you can carve
like that?" He said, "I don't know what to make!" There is the whole
thing. His neighbor said to him: "Why don't you ask your own
children?" Said he, "What is the use of doing that? My children are
different from other people's children." I used to see people like that
when I taught school. The next morning when his boy came down
the stairway, he said, "Sam, what do you want for a toy?" "I want a
wheelbarrow." When his little girl came down, he asked her what
she wanted, and she said, "I want a little doll's washstand, a little
doll's carriage, a little doll's umbrella," and went on with a whole lot
of things that would have taken his lifetime to supply. He consulted
his own children right there in his own house and began to whittle
out toys to please them. He began with his jack-knife, and made
those unpainted Hingham toys. He is the richest man in the entire
New England States, if Mr. Lawson is to be trusted in his statement
concerning such things, and yet that man's fortune was made by
consulting his own children in his own house. You don't need to go
out of your own house to find out what to invent or what to make. I
always talk too long on this subject.

I would like to meet the great men who are here to-night. The great
men! We don't have any great men in Philadelphia. Great men! You
say that they all come from London, or San Francisco, or Rome, or
Manayunk, or anywhere else but here—anywhere else but
Philadelphia—and yet, in fact, there are just as great men in
Philadelphia as in any city of its size. There are great men and
women in this audience. Great men, I have said, are very simple
men. Just as many great men here as are to be found anywhere. The

greatest error in judging great men is that we think that they always
hold an office. The world knows nothing of its greatest men. Who
are the great men of the world? The young man and young woman
may well ask the question. It is not necessary that they should hold
an office, and yet that is the popular idea. That is the idea we teach
now in our high schools and common schools, that the great men of
the world are those who hold some high office, and unless we
change that very soon and do away with that prejudice, we are going
to change to an empire. There is no question about it. We must teach
that men are great only on their intrinsic value, and not on the
position that they may incidentally happen to occupy. And yet, don't
blame the young men saying that they are going to be great when
they get into some official position. I ask this audience again who of
you are going to be great? Says a young man: "I am going to be
great." "When are you going to be great?" "When I am elected to
some political office." Won't you learn the lesson, young man; that it
is _prima facie_ evidence of littleness to hold public office under our
form of government? Think of it. This is a government of the
people, and by the people, and for the people, and not for the office-
holder, and if the people in this country rule as they always should
rule, an office-holder is only the servant of the people, and the Bible
says that "the servant cannot be greater than his master." The Bible
says that "he that is sent cannot be greater than him who sent him."
In this country the people are the masters, and the office-holders can
never be greater than the people; they should be honest servants of
the people, but they are not our greatest men. Young man, remember
that you never heard of a great man holding any political office in
this country unless he took that office at an expense to himself. It is
a loss to every great man to take a public office in our country. Bear
this in mind, young man, that you cannot be made great by a
political election.

Another young man says, "I am going to be a great man in
Philadelphia some time." "Is that so? When are you going to be
great?" "When there comes another war! When we get into difficulty
with Mexico, or England, or Russia, or Japan, or with Spain again
over Cuba, or with New Jersey, I will march up to the cannon's
mouth, and amid the glistening bayonets I will tear down their flag
from its staff, and I will come home with stars on my shoulders, and

hold every office in the gift of the government, and I will be great."
"No, you won't! No, you won't; that is no evidence of true greatness,
young man." But don't blame that young man for thinking that way;
that is the way he is taught in the high school. That is the way
history is taught in college. He is taught that the men who held the
office did all the fighting.

I remember we had a Peace Jubilee here in Philadelphia soon after
the Spanish war. Perhaps some of these visitors think we should not
have had it until now in Philadelphia, and as the great procession
was going up Broad street I was told that the tally-ho coach stopped
right in front of my house, and on the coach was Hobson, and all the
people threw up their hats and swung their handkerchiefs, and
shouted "Hurrah for Hobson!" I would have yelled too, because he
deserves much more of his country than he has ever received. But
suppose I go into the High School to-morrow and ask, "Boys, who
sunk the Merrimac?" If they answer me "Hobson," they tell me
seven-eighths of a lie—seven-eighths of a lie, because there were
eight men who sunk the Merrimac. The other seven men, by virtue
of their position, were continually exposed to the Spanish fire, while
Hobson, as an officer, might reasonably be behind the smoke-stack.
Why, my friends, in this intelligent audience gathered here to-night I
do not believe I could find a single person that can name the other
seven men who were with Hobson. Why do we teach history in that
way? We ought to teach that however humble the station a man may
occupy, if he does his full duty in his place, he is just as much
entitled to the American people's honor as is a king upon a throne.
We do teach it as a mother did her little boy in New York when he
said, "Mamma, what great building is that?" "That is General Grant's
tomb." "Who was General Grant?" "He was the man who put down
the rebellion." Is that the way to teach history?

Do you think we would have gained a victory if it had depended on
General Grant alone? Oh, no. Then why is there a tomb on the
Hudson at all? Why, not simply because General Grant was
personally a great man himself, but that tomb is there because he
was a representative man and represented two hundred thousand
men who went down to death for their nation and many of them as
great as General Grant. That is why that beautiful tomb stands on the

heights over the Hudson.

I remember an incident that will illustrate this, the only one that I
can give to-night. I am ashamed of it, but I don't dare leave it out. I
close my eyes now; I look back through the years to [^1]:[^8]:[^6]:[^3]:; I can see
my native town in the Berkshire Hills, I can see that cattle-show
ground filled with people; I can see the church there and the town
hall crowded, and hear bands playing, and see flags flying and
handkerchiefs streaming—well do I recall at this moment that day.
The people had turned out to receive a company of soldiers, and that
company came marching up on the Common. They had served out
one term in the Civil War and had reënlisted, and they were being
received by their native townsmen. I was but a boy, but I was captain
of that company, puffed out with pride on that day—why, a cambric
needle would have burst me all to pieces. As I marched on the
Common at the head of my company, there was not a man more
proud than I. We marched into the town hall and then they seated my
soldiers down in the center of the house and I took my place down
on the front seat, and then the town officers filed through the great
throng of people, who stood close and packed in that little hall. They
came up on the platform, formed a half circle around it, and the
mayor of the town, the "chairman of the Selectmen" in New
England, took his seat in the middle of that half circle. He was an
old man, his hair was gray; he never held an office before in his life.
He thought that an office was all he needed to be a truly great man,
and when he came up he adjusted his powerful spectacles and
glanced calmly around the audience with amazing dignity. Suddenly
his eyes fell upon me, and then the good old man came right forward
and invited me to come up on the stand with the town officers.
Invited me up on the stand! No town officer ever took notice of me
before I went to war. Now, I should not say that. One town officer
was there who advised the teacher to "whale" me, but I mean no
"honorable mention." So I was invited up on the stand with the town
officers. I took my seat and let my sword fall on the floor, and folded
my arms across my breast and waited to be received. Napoleon the
Fifth! Pride goeth before destruction and a fall. When I had gotten
my seat and all became silent through the hall, the chairman of the
Selectmen arose and came forward with great dignity to the table,
and we all supposed he would introduce the Congregational

minister, who was the only orator in the town, and who would give
the oration to the returning soldiers. But, friends, you should have
seen the surprise that ran over that audience when they discovered
that this old farmer was going to deliver that oration himself. He had
never made a speech in his life before, but he fell into the same error
that others have fallen into, he seemed to think that the office would
make him an orator. So he had written out a speech and walked up
and down the pasture until he had learned it by heart and frightened
the cattle, and he brought that manuscript with him, and taking it
from his pocket, he spread it carefully upon the table. Then he
adjusted his spectacles to be sure that he might see it, and walked far
back on the platform and then stepped forward like this. He must
have studied the subject much, for he assumed an elocutionary
attitude; he rested heavily upon his left heel, slightly advanced the
right foot, threw back his shoulders, opened the organs of speech,
and advanced his right hand at an angle of forty-five. As he stood in
that elocutionary attitude this is just the way that speech went, this is
it precisely. Some of my friends have asked me if I do not
exaggerate it, but I could not exaggerate it. Impossible! This is the
way it went; although I am not here for the story but the lesson that
is back of it:

"Fellow citizens." As soon as he heard his voice, his hand began to
shake like that, his knees began to tremble, and then he shook all
over. He coughed and choked and finally came around to look at his
manuscript. Then he began again: "Fellow citizens: We—are—we
are—we are—we are—We are very happy—we are very happy—we
are very happy—to welcome back to their native town these soldiers
who have fought and bled—and come back again to their native
town. We are especially—we are especially—we are especially—we
are especially pleased to see with us to-day this young hero (that
meant me)—this young hero who in imagination (friends, remember,
he said "imagination," for if he had not said that, I would not be
egotistical enough to refer to it)—this young hero who, in
imagination, we have seen leading his troops—leading—we have
seen leading—we have seen leading his troops on to the deadly
breach. We have seen his shining—his shining—we have seen his
shining—we have seen his shining—his shining sword—flashing in
the sunlight as he shouted to his troops, 'Come on!'"

Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear! How little that good, old man knew about
war. If he had known anything about war, he ought to have known
what any soldier in this audience knows is true, that it is next to a
crime for an officer of infantry ever in time of danger to go ahead of
his men. I, with my shining sword flashing in the sunlight, shouting
to my troops: "Come on." I never did it. Do you suppose I would go
ahead of my men to be shot in the front by the enemy and in the
back by my own men? That is no place for an officer. The place for
the officer is behind the private soldier in actual fighting. How often,
as a staff officer, I rode down the line when the Rebel cry and yell
was coming out of the woods, sweeping along over the fields, and
shouted, "Officers to the rear! Officers to the rear!" and then every
officer goes behind the line of battle, and the higher the officer's
rank, the farther behind he goes. Not because he is any the less
brave, but because the laws of war require that to be done. If the
general came up on the front line and were killed you would lose
your battle anyhow, because he has the plan of the battle in his brain,
and must be kept in comparative safety. I, with my "shining sword
flashing in the sunlight." Ah! There sat in the hall that day men who
had given that boy their last hard-tack, who had carried him on their
backs through deep rivers. But some were not there; they had gone
down to death for their country. The speaker mentioned them, but
they were but little noticed, and yet they had gone down to death for
their country, gone down for a cause they believed was right and still
believe was right, though I grant to the other side the same that I ask
for myself. Yet these men who had actually died for their country
were little noticed, and the hero of the hour was this boy. Why was
he the hero? Simply because that man fell into that same foolishness.
This boy was an officer, and those were only private soldiers. I
learned a lesson that I will never forget. Greatness consists not in
holding some office; greatness really consists in doing some great
deed with little means, in the accomplishment of vast purposes from
the private ranks of life; that is true greatness. He who can give to
this people better streets, better homes, better schools, better
churches, more religion, more of happiness, more of God, he that
can be a blessing to the community in which he lives to-night will be
great anywhere, but he who cannot be a blessing where he now lives
will never be great anywhere on the face of God's earth. "We live in
deeds, not years, in feeling, not in figures on a dial; in thoughts, not

breaths; we should count time by heart throbs, in the cause of right."
Bailey says: "He most lives who thinks most."

If you forget everything I have said to you, do not forget this,
because it contains more in two lines than all I have said. Bailey
says: "He most lives who thinks most, who feels the noblest, and
who acts the best."

HONORE DE BALZAC
```

```
Delivered at the Funeral of Balzac, August 20, 1850.
```

Gentlemen: The man who now goes down into this tomb is one of
those to whom public grief pays homage.

In one day all fictions have vanished. The eye is fixed not only on
the heads that reign, but on heads that think, and the whole country
is moved when one of those heads disappears. To-day we have a
people in black because of the death of the man of talent; a nation in
mourning for a man of genius.

Gentlemen, the name of Balzac will be mingled in the luminous
trace our epoch will leave across the future.

Balzac was one of that powerful generation of writers of the
nineteenth century who came after Napoleon, as the illustrious
Pleiad of the seventeenth century came after Richelieu,—as if in the
development of civilization there were a law which gives conquerors
by the intellect as successors to conquerors by the sword.

Balzac was one of the first among the greatest, one of the highest
among the best. This is not the place to tell all that constituted this
splendid and sovereign intelligence. All his books form but one
book,—a book living, luminous, profound, where one sees coming
and going and marching and moving, with I know not what of the
formidable and terrible, mixed with the real, all our contemporary
civilization;—a marvelous book which the poet entitled "a comedy"
and which he could have called history; which takes all forms and

all style, which surpasses Tacitus and Suetonius; which traverses
Beaumarchais and reaches Rabelais;—a book which realizes
observation and imagination, which lavishes the true, the esoteric,
the commonplace, the trivial, the material, and which at times
through all realities, swiftly and grandly rent away, allows us all at
once a glimpse of a most sombre and tragic ideal. Unknown to
himself, whether he wished it or not, whether he consented or not,
the author of this immense and strange work is one of the strong race
of Revolutionist writers. Balzac goes straight to the goal.

Body to body he seizes modern society; from all he wrests
something, from these an illusion, from those a hope; from one a
catch-word, from another a mask. He ransacked vice, he dissected
passion. He searched out and sounded man, soul, heart, entrails,
brain,—the abyss that each one has within himself. And by grace of
his free and vigorous nature; by a privilege of the intellect of our
time, which, having seen revolutions face to face, can see more
clearly the destiny of humanity and comprehend Providence better,
—Balzac redeemed himself smiling and severe from those
formidable studies which produced melancholy in Moliere and
misanthropy in Rousseau.

This is what he has accomplished among us, this is the work which
he has left us,—a work lofty and solid,—a monument robustly piled
in layers of granite, from the height of which hereafter his renown
shall shine in splendor. Great men make their own pedestal, the
future will be answerable for the statue.

His death stupefied Paris! Only a few months ago he had come back
to France. Feeling that he was dying, he wished to see his country
again, as one who would embrace his mother on the eve of a distant
voyage. His life was short, but full, more filled with deeds than days.

Alas! this powerful worker, never fatigued, this philosopher, this
thinker, this poet, this genius, has lived among us that life of storm,
of strife, of quarrels and combats, common in all times to all great
men. To-day he is at peace. He escapes contention and hatred. On
the same day he enters into glory and the tomb. Thereafter beyond
the clouds, which are above our heads, he will shine among the stars
of his country. All you who are here, are you not tempted to envy

him?

Whatever may be our grief in presence of such a loss, let us accept
these catastrophes with resignation! Let us accept in it whatever is
distressing and severe; it is good perhaps, it is necessary perhaps, in
an epoch like ours, that from time to time the great dead shall
communicate to spirits devoured with skepticism and doubt, a
religious fervor. Providence knows what it does when it puts the
people face to face with the supreme mystery and when it gives
them death to reflect on,—death which is supreme equality, as it is
also supreme liberty. Providence knows what it does, since it is the
greatest of all instructors.

There can be but austere and serious thoughts in all hearts when a
sublime spirit makes its majestic entrance into another life, when
one of those beings who have long soared above the crowd on the
visible wings of genius, spreading all at once other wings which we
did not see, plunges swiftly into the unknown.

No, it is not the unknown; no, I have said it on another sad occasion
and I shall repeat it to-day, it is not night, it is light. It is not the end,
it is the beginning! It is not extinction, it is eternity! Is it not true, my
hearers, such tombs as this demonstrate immortality? In presence of
the illustrious dead, we feel more distinctly the divine destiny of that
intelligence which traverses the earth to suffer and to purify itself,—
which we call man.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark. Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission. If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research. They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks. Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).

Section [^1]:. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

[^1]:.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph [^1]:.E.[^8]:.

[^1]:.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph [^1]:.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works. See paragraph [^1]:.E below.

[^1]:.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work. You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

[^1]:.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

[^1]:.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

[^1]:.E.[^1]:. The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

[^1]:.E.[^2]:. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges. If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs [^1]:.E.1
through [^1]:.E.[^7]: or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs [^1]:.E.[^8]: or
[^1]:.E.[^9]:.

[^1]:.E.[^3]:. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs [^1]:.E.[^1]: through [^1]:.E.[^7]: and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

[^1]:.E.[^4]:. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

[^1]:.E.[^5]:. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph [^1]:.E.[^1]: with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

[^1]:.E.[^6]:. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form. Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph [^1]:.E.[^1]:.

[^1]:.E.[^7]:. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph [^1]:.E.[^8]: or [^1]:.E.[^9]:.

[^1]:.E.[^8]:. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is
owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments
must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
returns. Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License. You must require such a user to return or
destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
Project Gutenberg-tm works.
- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
of receipt of the work.
- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

```
distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.
```

[^1]:.E.[^9]:. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section [^3]: below.

[^1]:.F.

[^1]:.F.[^1]:. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain

Section [^2]:. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In [^2]:[^0]:[^0]:[^1]:, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section [^4]:. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($[^1]: to $[^5]:,[^0]:[^0]:[^0]:) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt

status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all [^5]:[^0]: states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations. To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

Section [^5]:. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

```
http://www.gutenberg.net
```

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
